<h2>NOTE.</h2>


<p>The translation has been thoroughly revised for the
sense as well as in regard to technical military terms
and expressions. To the name of every German general
officer mentioned in the text has been affixed, within
brackets, his specific command, a liberty which the
reader will perhaps not resent, since the interpolation
is intended to facilitate his clearer understanding of
a narrative condensed by the author with extreme
severity.</p>

<p>In further aid of elucidation there has been occasionally
inserted, also within brackets, a date, a figure,
or a word.</p>

<p>A few footnotes will be found, which may perhaps
be excused as not wholly irrelevant. In the Appendix
have been inserted the "Orders of Battle" of both sides,
as in the first period of the war.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Field-Marshal von Moltke began this history of the
War of 1870&mdash;1 in the spring of the year 1887, and
during his residence at Creisau he worked at it for
about three hours every morning. On his return to
Berlin in the autumn of that year, the work was not
quite finished, but he completed it by January, 1888,
at Berlin, placed it in my hands, and never again
alluded to the subject.</p>

<p>The origin of the book was as follows. I had several
times entreated him, but in vain, to make use of his
leisure hours at Creisau in noting down some of his
rich store of reminiscences. He always objected, in
the same words: "Everything official that I have had
occasion to write, or that is worth remembering, is to be
seen in the Archives of the Staff Corps. My personal
experiences had better be buried with me." He had a
dislike to memoirs in general, which he was at no pains
to conceal, saying that they only served to gratify the
writer's vanity, and often contributed to distort important
historical events by the subjective views of an
individual, and the intrusion of trivial details. It
might easily happen that a particular character which
in history stood forth in noble simplicity should be
hideously disfigured by the narrative of some personal
experiences, and the ideal halo which had surrounded
it be destroyed. And highly characteristic of
Moltke's magnanimity are the words he once uttered
on such an occasion, and which I noted at the time:
"Whatever is published in a military history is always
dressed for effect: yet it is a duty of piety and patriotism
never to impair the prestige which identifies the
glory of our Army with personages of lofty position."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after our arrival at Creisau, early in 1887, I
repeated my suggestion. In reply to my request that
he would write an account of the Campaign of 1870&mdash;1,
he said: "You have the official history of the war.
That contains everything. I admit," he added, "that
it is too full of detail for the general type of readers,
and far too technical. An abridgment must be made
some day." I asked him whether he would allow me
to lay the work on his table, and next morning he
began the narrative contained in this volume, and
comparing it as he went on with the official history,
carried it through to the end.</p>

<p>His purpose was to give a concise account of the
war. But, while keeping this in view, he involuntarily&mdash;as
was unavoidable in his position&mdash;regarded
the undertaking from his own standpoint as Chief of
the General Staff, and marshalled results so as to agree
as a whole with the plan of campaign which was known
only to the higher military authorities. Thus this
work, which was undertaken in all simplicity of purpose,
as a popular history, is practically from beginning
to end the expression of a private opinion of the war
by the Field-Marshal himself.</p>

<p>The Appendix: "On a pretended Council of War in
the Wars of William I. of Prussia," was written in
1881. In a book by Fedor von Koppen, "Männer
und Thaten, vaterländische Balladen" (<i>Men and Deeds:
Patriotic Songs</i>), which the poet presented to the Field-Marshal,
there is a poem entitled, "<i>A German Council
of War at Versailles</i>" (with a historical note appended),
describing an incident which never occurred, and
which, under the conditions by which the relations
of the Chief of the Staff to his Majesty were regulated,
never could have occurred. To preclude any such
mistakes for the future, and to settle once and for all
the truth as to the much-discussed question of the
Council of War, the Field-Marshal wrote this paper,
to which he added a description of his personal experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
of the battle of Königgrätz. It is this narrative
which, shortly after the writer's death, was published
in the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> of Munich, in the somewhat
abridged and altered form in which the Field-Marshal
had placed it at the disposal of Professor von Treitscke,
the well-known historian.</p>

<h2>THE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR.</h2>




<h2>PART I.</h2>


<p>The days are gone by when, for dynastical ends, small
armies of professional soldiers went to war to conquer
a city, or a province, and then sought winter quarters
or made peace. The wars of the present day call whole
nations to arms; there is scarcely a family that has not
had to bewail lost ones. The entire financial resources
of the State are appropriated to military purposes, and
the seasons of the year have no influence on the unceasing
progress of hostilities. As long as nations
exist distinct one from the other there will be quarrels
that can only be settled by force of arms; but, in the
interests of humanity, it is to be hoped that wars will
become the less frequent, as they become the more
terrible.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it is no longer the ambition of
monarchs which endangers peace; but the impulses of
a nation, its dissatisfaction with its internal conditions,
the strife of parties and the intrigues of their leaders.
A declaration of war, so serious in its consequences, is
more easily carried by a large assembly, of which no
one of the members bears the sole responsibility, than
by a single individual, however lofty his position; and
a peace-loving sovereign is less rare than a parliament
composed of wise men. The great wars of recent times
have been declared against the wish and will of the
reigning powers. Now-a-days the Bourse possesses so
great influence that it is able to have armies called
into the field merely to protect its interests. Mexico<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and Egypt have had European armies of occupation
inflicted upon them simply to satisfy the demands of
the <i>haute finance</i>. To-day the question is not so much
whether a nation is strong enough to make war, as
whether its Government is powerful enough to prevent
war. For example, united Germany has hitherto used
her strength only to maintain European peace; while
the weakness of a neighbouring Government continues
to involve the gravest risk of war.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, from such a condition of relations
that the war of 1870&mdash;71 originated. A Napoleon on
the throne of France was bound to justify his pretensions
by political and military successes. Only temporarily
was the French nation contented by the victories
of its arms in remote fields of war; the triumphs of
the Prussian armies excited jealousy, they were regarded
as arrogant, as a challenge; and the French demanded
revenge for Sadowa. The liberal spirit of the epoch
set itself against the autocratic Government of the
Emperor; he was forced to make concessions, his
internal authority was weakened, and one day the
nation was informed by its representatives that it
desired war with Germany.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Preparations for War.</span></h2>


<p>The wars carried on by France beyond seas, essentially
on behalf of financial interests, had consumed immense
sums and had undermined the discipline of the army.
Her army was by no means in thorough preparedness
for a great war, but, in the temper of the nation, the
Spanish succession question furnished an opportune
pretext on which to go to war. The French Reserves
were called out on July 15th, and, as if the opportunity
for a rupture was on no account to be let slip, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
four days later the French declaration of war was presented
at Berlin.</p>

<p>One Division of the French Army was ordered to
the Spanish frontier as a corps of observation; only
such troops as were absolutely necessary were left in
Algiers and in Civita Vecchia; Paris and Lyons were
sufficiently garrisoned. The entire remainder of the
army: 332 battalions, 220 squadrons, 924 guns, in all
about 300,000 men, formed the Army of the Rhine,
which, divided into eight Corps, was, at any rate in the
first instance, to be under the sole direction of a central
head. The Emperor himself was the fitting person to
undertake this weighty duty, pending whose arrival
Marshal Bazaine was to command the gathering forces.</p>

<p>It is very probable that the French reckoned on the
old dissensions of the German races. Not that they
dared to look forward to the South Germans as allies,
but they hoped to paralyze their offensive by an early
victory, perhaps even to win them over to their side.
It was true that Prussia by herself was still a mighty
antagonist, and that her armed forces were of superior
strength; but peradventure this advantage might be
counterbalanced by rapidity of action.</p>

<p>The French plan of campaign was indeed based on
the delivery of sudden unexpected attacks. The
powerful fleet of war-ships and transports was to be
utilized to land a considerable force in Northern
Prussia, which should there engage a part of the
Prussian troops, while the main body of the German
army, it was assumed, would await the first French
attack behind the strong defensive line of the Rhine.
A French force was to cross the Rhine promptly, at
and below Strasburg, thus avoiding the great German
fortresses; its function being, at the very outset of the
campaign, to cut off the South-German army charged
with the defence of the Black Forest, and prevent it
from effecting a junction with the North Germans.
In the execution of this plan it was imperative that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
main body of the French army should be massed in
Alsace. Railway accommodation, however, was so
inadequate that in the first instance it was only possible
to transport 100,000 men to Strasburg; 150,000 had to
leave the railway at Metz, and remain there till they
could be moved forward. Fifty thousand men in the
Châlons camp were intended to serve as supports, and
115 battalions were destined for field service as soon as
the National Guard should relieve them in the interior.
The various Corps were distributed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="right">Imperial Guard,</td><td align="left">General Bourbaki&mdash;Nancy.</td></tr>

</table>
</div>

<p>Thus while there were but two Corps in Alsace, there
were five on the Moselle; and, so early as the day of the
declaration of war, one of the latter, the IInd Corps,
had been pushed forward close to the German frontier,
about St. Avold and Forbach. General Frossard, its
commander, was, however, under strict injunctions to
commit himself to no serious undertaking.</p>

<p>The regiments had been hurried away from their
peace stations before the arrival of their complement of
men, and without waiting for their equipments. Meanwhile
the called-out reservists accumulated in the
depôts, overflowed the railway stations and choked the
traffic. Their transmission to their destinations was at
a standstill, for it was often unknown at the depôts
where the regiments to which the reservists were to be
sent were for the time encamped. When at length
they joined they were destitute of the most necessary
articles of equipment. The Corps and Divisions lacked
trains, hospitals and nearly the whole of the <i>personnel</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of their administration. No magazines had been established
in advance, and the troops were to depend on
the stores in the fortresses. These were in a neglected
state, for in the assured expectation that the armies
would be almost immediately launched into the enemy's
country they had received little attention. It was of a
piece with this that the French Staff-officers had been
provided with maps of Germany, but not of their own
country. The Ministry of War in Paris was overwhelmed
with claims, protestations, and expostulations,
till finally it was left to the troops to help themselves
as best they could. "<i>On se débrouillera</i>," was the hope
of the authorities.</p>

<p>When the Emperor arrived at Metz eight days after
the declaration of war, the forces were not yet up to their
strength, and even the precise whereabouts of whole
bodies of troops was for the time unknown. He
ordered the advance of the army, but his Marshals protested
that its internal plight was so unsatisfactory as to
make this impossible for the time. The general conviction
was gradually impressing itself on the French,
that instead of continuing to aim at invasion of the
enemy's country, their exertions would have to be confined
to the defence of their own territory. A strong
German army was reported to be assembling between
Mayence and Coblentz; and instead of reinforcements
being sent forward from Metz to Strasburg, much heavier
ones would have to be ordered from the Rhine to the
Saar. The determination to invade South Germany was
already abandoned; the fleet sailed, but without carrying
a force to be landed on the north German coast.</p>

<p>Germany had been surprised by the declaration of
war, but she was not unprepared. That was a possibility
which had been foreseen.</p>

<p>After the withdrawal of Austria from the German
connection, Prussia had taken upon itself the sole
leadership, and had gradually formed closer relations
with the South-German States. The idea of national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
unification had been revived, and found an echo in the
patriotic sentiments of the entire people.</p>

<p>The mobilization machinery of the North-German
army had been elaborated from year to year, in accord
with the changing conditions, by the combined exertions
of the War Ministry and the General Staff. Every
branch of the administration throughout the country
had been kept informed of all it needed to know in this
relation. The Berlin authorities had also come to
a confidential understanding with the Chiefs of the
General Staffs of the South-German States on all
important points. The principle was established that
Prussian assistance was not to be reckoned on for the
defence of any particular point, such as the Black Forest;
and that South Germany would be best protected by an
offensive movement into Alsace from the middle Rhine,
to be effectively supported by a large army massed
there. That the Governments of Bavaria, Würtemberg,
Baden and Hesse, to all appearance uncovering their
own territories, were ready to place their contingents
under the command of King William, proved their
entire confidence in the Prussian leadership.</p>

<p>This understanding enabled the preparations which
it entailed to be proceeded with. The train and march
tables were worked out for each body of troops, with
the most minute directions as to the respective starting-points,
the day and hour of departure, the duration of
the journey, the refreshment stations, and points of
detrainment. In the locality of concentration cantonments
were assigned to each Corps and Division, and
magazines were established with due regard to the most
convenient sites; and thus, when the stroke of war
inevitably impended, there was required only the Royal
signature to start the whole mighty movement in its
smooth, swift course. Nothing needed to be changed in
the directions originally given; it sufficed to follow the
plans previously thought out and prepared.</p>

<p>The aggregated mobile forces were formed into three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
separate Armies, on the basis of an elaborate tabular
statement drawn up by the Chief of the Prussian
General Staff.</p>

<p>The Ist Army, under the command of General von
Steinmetz, consisted of, in the first instance, only the
VIIth and VIIIth Corps, with one Division of cavalry;
60,000 men all told. It was ordered to assemble at
Wittlich and form the right wing.</p>

<p>The IInd Army, under the command of Prince
Frederick Charles, consisted of the IIIrd, IVth, Xth,
and Guard Corps, with two Divisions of cavalry. Assembling
in the vicinity of Homburg and Neunkirchen,
it was to form the centre, with a strength of 134,000 men.</p>

<p>The IIIrd Army, under the command of the Crown
Prince of Prussia, consisted of the Vth and XIth
Prussian, and the Ist and IInd Bavarian Corps, the
Würtemberg and Baden Field Divisions, with one Division
of cavalry. Its approximate strength was 130,000
men; it was to constitute the left wing, and to concentrate
about Landau and Rastatt.</p>

<p>The IXth Corps, consisting of the 18th and the
Hesse Divisions, was along with the XIIth Royal Saxon
Corps to form a reserve of 60,000 men in front of
Mayence, for the reinforcement of the IInd Army to a
strength of 194,000 men.</p>

<p>The three Armies numbered together 384,000 men.</p>

<p>There still remained the Ist, IInd, and VIth
Corps, numbering 100,000 men; but they were not
at first included, as railway transport for them was
not available for three weeks to come. The 17th
Division and certain bodies of Landwehr troops were
detailed to defend the coasts.</p>

<p>It is apparent that numerically the German armies
were considerably superior to the French. Inclusive
of the garrisons and reserves about one million of
men and over 200,000 horses were on the ration list.</p>

<p>On the night of July 16th the Royal order for
mobilization was issued, and when his  Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
arrived in Mayence fourteen days later, he found
300,000 men assembled on the Rhine and beyond.</p>

<p>The plan of campaign submitted by the Chief of
the General Staff, and accepted by the King, proves
that officer to have had his eye fixed, from the first,
upon the capture of the enemy's capital, the possession
of which is of more importance in France than in
other countries. On the way thither the hostile forces
were to be driven as persistently as possible back from
the fertile southern provinces into the more confined
background to the north. But beyond everything the
plan of campaign was based on the resolve to attack the
enemy at once, wherever found, and keep the German
forces always so compact that this could be done
with the advantage of superior numbers. The specific
dispositions for the accomplishment of those objects
were left to be adopted on the spot; the advance to the
frontier was alone pre-arranged in every detail.</p>

<p>It is a delusion to imagine that a plan of campaign
can be laid down far ahead and fulfilled with exactitude.
The first collision with the enemy creates a new
situation in accordance with its result. Some things
intended will have become impracticable; others, which
originally seemed impossible, become feasible. All
that the leader of an army can do is to form a correct
estimate of the circumstances, to decide for the best for
the moment, and carry out his purpose unflinchingly.</p>

<p>The advance of the French troops to the frontier,
while as yet imperfectly mobilized, which was an extremely
hazardous measure in itself, was evidently with
the intent of utilizing the temporary advantage of
having a superior force at immediate disposition by
taking at unawares the German armies in the act of
developing their advance-movements. But, notwithstanding,
the German commanders did not deviate
from their purpose of promptly effecting this first
advance in front of the Rhine. The railway transport
of the Corps of the IInd and IIIrd Armies, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
ended at the Rhine; thence the troops marched on foot
into the cantonments prepared on the left bank of the
river. They moved in echelon, advancing only so
many at a time as would make room for the body
in rear, in the first instance to the line Bingen-Dürkheim-Landau.
The farther advance towards the
frontier was not to be undertaken until the Divisions
and Corps were all assembled, and provided with the
necessary trains; and then they were to march forward
in a state of readiness to confront the enemy at any
moment.</p>

<p>The massing of the Ist Army appeared to be
less threatened, because its route was protected by
neutral territory, and was covered by the garrisons of
Trèves, Saarlouis and Saarbrücken, the German outposts
on the Saar.</p>

<p>The Ist Army, 50,000 strong, was concentrated at
Wadern, in the first days of August. The IInd Army,
which meanwhile had been increased to a strength of
194,000 men, had pushed forward its cantonments
to Alsenz-Günnstadt, at the farther base of the Haardt
Mountains, a position which had been thoroughly inspected
by an officer of the General Staff, and where
the troops might confidently await an attack. The 5th
and 6th cavalry Divisions were reconnoitring the country
in front. The IIIrd Army was still assembling on
both banks of the Rhine.</p>

<p>The French so far had made no serious attempt at
Saarbrücken; Lieutenant-Colonel Pestel, with one
battalion and three squadrons, was able successfully to
withstand their petty attacks. It had meanwhile been
observed that the hostile forces were moving farther to
the right, towards Forbach and Bitsch. This seemed to
indicate that the two French Corps known to be about
Belfort and Strasburg, might purpose crossing the Rhine
and marching through the Black Forest. It seemed
therefore all the more important that the IIIrd Army
should be set in motion as early as possible, for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
thing to protect the right bank of the Upper Rhine by
an advance on the left; for another, to cover the left
flank of the IInd Army during its advance.</p>

<p>A telegraphic order to that effect was despatched
on the evening of July 30th, but the Head-quarters of
the IIIrd Army wished to wait for the arrival of the
VIth Corps and of the trains. Whereupon, regardless
of this delay, the IInd Army was put in march
towards the Saar, where the French were beginning
to be active.</p>

<p>The time had gone by when they might have taken
advantage of their over-hasty mobilization; the inefficient
condition of the troops had paralyzed every
attempt at activity. France had been long waiting
for the news of a victory, and something had to be done
to appease public impatience. So, in order to do something,
it was resolved (as is usual in such circumstances)
to undertake a reconnoissance in force, and, it may be
added, with the usual result.</p>

<p>On August 2nd three entire Army Corps were set
in motion against three battalions, four squadrons, and
one battery in Saarbrücken. The Emperor himself and
the Prince Imperial shared in the enterprise. The
IIIrd Corps advanced on Völklingen, the Vth through
Saargemünd, the IInd on Saarbrücken.</p>

<p>Saarbrücken was evacuated after a gallant defence
and repeated counter-strokes, but the French did not
press across the Saar; convinced, possibly, that they had
wasted their strength in a stroke in the air, and had
nowhere gained any insight into the dispositions of the
enemy.</p>

<p>The French military chiefs now hesitated for a long
while between conflicting resolutions. Orders were
given and recalled on the strength of mere rumours.
The left wing was reinforced because 40,000
Prussians were supposed to have marched through
Trèves, the Guard received contradictory orders, and
the bare apparition of a small German force about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Lörrach in the Black Forest occasioned the order
that the VIIth Corps must remain in Alsace. Thus
the French forces were straggled over the wide area
between the Nied and the Upper Rhine, while the
Germans were advancing in compact masses towards
the Saar.</p>

<p>This scattered state of their forces finally induced
the French leaders to divide them into two separate
Armies. Marshal MacMahon took command, but only
provisionally, of the Ist, VIIth, and Vth Corps, of which
the latter had therefore to draw in to him from Bitsch.
The other Corps remained under Marshal Bazaine, with
the exception of the Imperial Guard, the command of
which the Emperor reserved to himself.</p>

<p>It had now become a pressing necessity to protect the
left wing of the advancing IInd German Army against
the French forces in Alsace, and the IIIrd Army was
therefore ordered to cross the frontier on August 4th,
without waiting any longer for its trains. The Ist
Army, forming the right wing, was in complete readiness
near Wadern and Losheim, three or four days'
march nearer to the Saar than the IInd Army in the
centre. It received the order to concentrate in the
neighbourhood of Tholey and there halt for the present.
For one thing, this army, the weakest of the three, could
not be exposed single-handed to an encounter with
the enemy's main force; and for another, it was available
to serve as an offensive flank in case the IInd
Army should meet the enemy on emerging from the
forest zone of the Palatinate.</p>

<p>In the execution of this order, the Ist Army had so
extended its cantonments southward that they trenched
on the line of march of the IInd Army, and it had to
evacuate the quarters about Ottweiler in favour of the
latter. This involved a difficulty, as all the villages to
the north were full, and as room had also to be found for
the Ist Corps, now advancing by Birkenfeld. General
von Steinmetz therefore decided to march his whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
army in the direction of Saarlouis and Saarbrücken.
The IInd Army, on August 4th, stood assembled ready
for action, and received orders to deploy on the farther
side of the forest zone of Kaiserslautern.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Combat of Weissenburg.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(August 4th.)</div>


<p>On this day the Corps of the IIIrd Army, consisting
of 128 battalions, 102 squadrons, and 80 batteries,
which had been assembled in bivouac behind the Klingsbach,
crossed the French frontier, marching on a broad
front to reach the Lauter between Weissenburg and
Lauterburg. This stream affords an exceptionally
strong defensive position, but on August 4th only one
weak Division and a cavalry brigade of the Ist French
Corps covered this point, the main body of that Corps
being still on the march towards the Palatinate.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the Bavarians forming the
right wing encountered a lively resistance before
the walls of Weissenburg, which were too strong to be
stormed. But very soon after the two Prussian Corps
crossed the Lauter lower down. General von Bose
led forward the XIth Corps (which he commanded)
with intent to turn the French right flank on the
Geisberg, while General von Kirchbach, with the Vth
Corps (which he commanded) advanced against the
enemy's front. Thirty field-guns were meanwhile
massed against the railway station of Weissenburg.
It and subsequently the town were taken, after a bloody
struggle.</p>

<p>So early as ten o'clock General Douay had ordered a
retreat, which was seriously threatened by the movement
against the Geisburg; and the château of that
name, a very defensible building, was most obstinately
defended to enable the French to retire. The Grenadiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the King's Regiment No. 7 in vain assailed
it by storm, suffering heavy loss; nor did its
defenders surrender until, with the greatest difficulty,
artillery had been dragged up on to the height.</p>

<p>The French Division, which had been attacked by
three German Corps, effected a retreat after an obstinate
struggle, though in great disorder, having suffered
much loss. Its gallant Commander had been killed.
The Germans had to bewail a proportionately considerable
loss; their casualties were 91 officers and 1460
men. General von Kirchbach had been wounded
while fighting in the foremost rank.</p>

<p>The 4th Division of cavalry had met with much
delay in the course of a nineteen miles' march by the
crossing of the columns of infantry. It did not reach
the scene of combat, and all touch of the enemy, now
retiring to the westward, was lost.</p>

<p>Uncertain as to the direction whence fresh hostile
forces might be approaching, the IIIrd Army advanced
on the 5th of August by diverging roads in the direction
of Hagenau and Reichshofen; yet not so far apart but
that it should be possible for the Corps to reconcentrate
in one short march. The Crown Prince intended
to allow his troops a rest on the following day, so as to
have them fresh for a renewed attack as soon as the
situation was made clear.</p>

<p>But already, that same evening, the Bavarians on
the right flank and the Vth Corps in the front had a
sharp encounter with the enemy, who showed behind
the Sauer in considerable strength. It was to be
assumed that Marshal MacMahon had brought up the
VIIth Corps from Strasburg, but it remained a question
whether he intended to join Marshal Bazaine by
way of Bitsch, or whether, having secured his line of
retreat thither, he meant to accept battle at Wörth.
Yet again there was the possibility that he might himself
initiate the offensive. The Crown Prince, to make
sure in any case of a preponderance of force, determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to concentrate his army in the neighbourhood of Sulz
on August 6th. The IInd Bavarian Corps received
separate instructions to watch the road from Bitsch with
one Division; the other Division was to strike the hostile
attack in flank on the western bank of the Sauer, in
the event of artillery fire about Wörth being heard.</p>

<p>Marshal MacMahon was endeavouring with all his
might to concentrate his three Corps, and he really had
the intention to make an immediate attack on his
invading foe. A Division of the VIIth Corps, which
had but just been sent to Mülhausen to strengthen the
defence of Alsace, was at once recalled to Hagenau,
and early on the 6th formed the right wing of the
strong position which the Ist Corps had taken up behind
the Sauer, and in front of Fröschwiller, Elsasshausen,
and Eberbach. On the left, Lespart's Division
of the Vth Corps was expected from Bitsch, of which
the other Divisions were only now on march from
Saargemünd by way of Rohrbach. Meanwhile Ducrot's
Division formed a refused flank on the French left.</p>

<p>Neither the German nor the French leaders expected
the collision before the following day, but when, as in
this case, the adversaries are in so close proximity, the
conflict may break out at any moment, even against
the wish of the higher commanders.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Wörth.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(August 6th.)</div>


<p>After a good deal of skirmishing between the respective
outposts during the night, the Commander of
the 20th German Brigade<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> thought it expedient to seize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
a passage over the Sauer, which flowed just in his
front and constituted a serious obstacle. The bridge
leading to Wörth had been destroyed, but the sharp-shooters
waded through the river, and at seven o'clock
pressed into the town, which the French had left
unoccupied.</p>

<p>Soon enough they realized that before them was a
numerous enemy in a strong position.</p>

<p>The broad meadows of the Sauer all lie within effective
range of the commanding slopes on the right bank;
and the long-ranging chassepôt fire could not but tell
heavily. On the French side of the river the terrain
was dotted with vineyards and hop-gardens, which
afforded great advantages for defensive purposes.</p>

<p>The combat which had begun at Wörth was broken
off after lasting half an hour, but the artillery of both
sides had taken part in it, and the sound of cannon-fire
had been the signal prescribed to Hartmann's IInd
Bavarian Corps, acting on which it now advanced from
Langensulzbach, and was soon engaged in a brisk fight
with the left flank of the French. The latter on their
side had advanced on their right to the attack of Gunstett,
where they came in contact with the advancing
XIth Prussian Corps.</p>

<p>The din of battle, rolling from the north and south
alike, was heard by the Vth Corps in its position
opposite to Wörth; and it seemed imperative that it
should engage with vigour the enemy's centre in order
to hinder him from throwing himself with all his
strength on one or other of the German flanks.</p>

<p>The artillery was brought up, and by ten o'clock 108
guns were in action on the eastern slope of the Sauer
valley.</p>

<p>Some infantry detachments waded breast-high
through the river, but this dashing attempt, undertaken
in inadequate strength, miscarried, and it was
only by strenuous efforts that a foothold was maintained
on the other side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The Crown Prince sent orders that nothing was to
be undertaken that would bring on a battle on that
day. But by this time the Vth Corps was so seriously
engaged that the fight could not be broken off without
obvious disadvantage. General von Kirchbach therefore
determined to continue the contest on his own
responsibility.</p>

<p>The frontal attack was an undertaking of great
difficulty, and could scarcely succeed unless with the
co-operation of another on the flank. But at this juncture
the Bavarians, who, in position as they were on the
right, could have afforded this co-operation, obeyed the
breaking off command, which had also reached them in
the course of the fighting, and withdrew to Langensulzbach.
There was, however, the XIth Corps in
position on the left, eager to strike in. It seized the
Albrechts-häuser farm, and pressed forward into the
Niederwald.</p>

<p>In front of Wörth the battle hung, consisting of a
succession of attacks renewed again and again on either
side; each assailant in turn getting worsted, in consequence
of the nature of the country. By degrees, however,
the collective battalions, and finally the artillery
of the Vth Corps, were brought over to the west bank of
the Sauer; while the XIth Corps had already won
there a firm point of support for further advance.</p>

<p>Just then, near Morsbronn, notwithstanding the evident
unfavourable nature of the ground, two Cuirassier
and one Lancer regiments of Michel's brigade hurled
themselves with reckless daring on a body of German
infantry taken in the act of wheeling to the right.
But the 32nd Regiment, far from seeking cover,
received in open order the charging mass of over
1000 horse with a steady fire which did great execution.
The Cuirassiers especially suffered immense
loss. Only a few horsemen broke through the
firing line and gained the open ground; many were
taken prisoners in the village, the remainder rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in wild gallop as far as Walburg. There they encountered
the Prussian 13th Hussars, suffered further
loss, and disappeared from the field.</p>

<p>It is true that the infantry of the French right
wing succeeded in driving back the foremost detachments
of the Germans about Albrechts-häuser farm,
but the further advance of the former was shattered by
the fire of newly-unmasked artillery.</p>

<p>When finally the last battalions had crossed the
Sauer, the XIth Corps made its way through the
Niederwald, fighting its way step by step. The
northern edge of the forest was reached by 2.30, and
there a junction was formed with the left flank of the
Vth Corps. The burning village of Elsasshausen was
carried by storm, and the little copse south of Fröschwiller
was also won after a gallant defence.</p>

<p>Thus crowded together in a limited space, the French
army was in a situation of imminent danger. Its left
flank, it is true, still held out against the renewed attack
of the Bavarians, who had re-entered the action,
but its front and right flank were terribly hard
pressed, and even its retreat was seriously threatened.
Marshal MacMahon therefore tried to obtain a
breathing space by a heavy counter-stroke to the
south. The weak German detachments standing to
the east of Elsasshausen, thrown into confusion by
the vehement attack, were in part driven back into
the Niederwald, but were quickly rallied and brought
up again. Here the French cavalry strove once
more to change the fortunes of the day. Bonnemain's
Division, notwithstanding the unfavourable
nature of the ground, threw itself on the dishevelled
front of the enemy, suffered terrible losses, and was
shattered without having been able effectively to
charge home.</p>

<p>The Würtembergers now came up from the south,
and the Bavarians from the north. General von Bose,
though twice wounded, led what of his troops he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
could collect to the storm of the burning Fröschwiller,
the enemy's last stronghold. The artillery moved up
within case-shot range, and thus cleared the road for
the infantry which was pushing forward from all sides.
After maintaining to the utmost a resolute and gallant
resistance until five o'clock, the French retreated in
great disorder towards Reichshofen and Niederbronn.</p>

<p>At the Falkenstein stream, Lespart's Division, just
arrived on the field, made a short stand, but these
fresh troops offered only brief resistance, and were
swept away in the general rout.</p>

<p>This victory of the IIIrd Army had been dearly paid
for with the loss of 489 officers and 10,000 men. The
loss on the French side is not exactly known, but of
prisoners alone they left 200 officers and 9000 men,
and in the German hands there remained 33 guns and
2000 horses.</p>

<p>The disintegration of the French army must have
been so complete as to throw it altogether out of hand.
Only one brigade of Lespart's Division took the road by
Bitsch to join the French main army at St. Avold; all
the rest of the army, following an infectious impulse,
rolled unhaltingly in a south-western direction towards
Saverne.</p>

<p>As in the Head-quarter of the IIIrd Army it had not
been intended to fight on August 6th, the 4th Division of
cavalry had not left its quarters in the rear, and was
therefore not available to take up the pursuit; it did
not reach Gunstett until nine o'clock in the evening.
But, in order to be at hand at any rate for the next
day, Prince Albert marched his command on during
the night as far as Eberbach; after three hours' rest
he started again, and after covering thirty-six miles,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
came up in the evening with the rearguard of the
enemy near Steinberg, at the foot of the Vosges.
Without infantry it would have been impossible for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Division to push farther, but the sight of it gave the
enemy a fresh impulse of flight. The Ist Corps stampeded
again in the night and reached Saarburg, where
it joined the Vth Corps. Thus the French had a start
of twenty-three and a half miles, and continued their
retreat on Lunéville, unmolested by the Germans.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Spicheren.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(August 6th.)</div>


<p>Let us now turn to the events which occurred, on
this same 6th of August, in another part of the theatre
of war.</p>

<p>The IInd Army, its southern (left) flank covered by the
IIIrd Army, had been moving to the westward, while the
Corps it still lacked were being brought up by railway.
Its leading Corps, having traversed unmolested the
long defiles of the forest-belt of Kaiserslautern, reached
on the 5th the line Neunkirchen-Zweibrücken. The
cavalry, scouting into French territory, reported that
the enemy was retreating. Everything seemed to
indicate that the French would await the attack of the
Germans in a strong defensive position. The nearest
position of the kind that offered was that on the farther
bank of the Moselle, of which Metz protected one flank,
Thionville the other. It was decided that if the French
were found in that position, the Ist Army should hold
the enemy in front, while the IInd made a circuit south
of Metz, and so the enemy be forced either to retire
or to fight. In case of disaster the IInd Army was
to fall back on the IIIrd, now advancing over the
Vosges.</p>

<p>The protrusion to the south-westward<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the Ist Army
towards the Saar, which had not been intended by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
supreme Command, had brought its left wing in upon the
line of march laid down for the IInd, and detachments of
the two armies had to cross each other at Saarbrücken
on the 6th. Thus there was indeed no lack of strength
at that point; but as a battle on that day was neither
expected nor probable, the synchronous arrival of
troops had not been pre-arranged, and so detachments
could only come up by quite unprescribed routes and
arrive one after the other at different hours.</p>

<p>The 14th Division of the VIIth Corps was the first
to reach Saarbrücken, towards noon on the 6th.</p>

<p>General Frossard, considering his position there very
hazardous, had left the night before, without waiting
for permission, and had fallen back with the IInd Corps
on Spicheren, where it had entrenched itself. The
IIIrd, IVth, and Vth Corps were behind, at distances of
from nine to nineteen miles, and the Imperial Guard
was about twenty-three miles rearward. The Emperor,
therefore, had it in his power to collect five Corps for a
battle in the vicinity of Cocheren, or, on the other
hand, to support Frossard with at least four Divisions,
if that General were confident that his position was
strong enough to hold.</p>

<p>The range of heights which upheaves itself immediately
behind Saarbrücken is capable of affording a
serious obstacle to a hostile passage of the Saar. It
was known that the French had evacuated those
heights, but General von Kameke thought it prudent
to seize them at once, in order to secure the debouche
of the columns following him. When, in the forenoon,
two squadrons of the 5th Cavalry Division showed
themselves on the drill-ground on the ridge above the
farther bank, they were greeted with a hot fire from
the Spicheren heights. But as it seemed highly probable,
from the previous behaviour of the French, that
the force seen there was only the rear-guard of the
retiring enemy, General von Kameke (commanding
14th Infantry Division) ordered an immediate attack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
since he had the promise of reinforcements. General
von Zastrow (commanding VIIth Corps), as soon as he
recognized that the 14th Division had involved itself in
a serious engagement, allowed the 13th to go forward.
General von Alvensleben (its commander) also ordered
up to Saarbrücken all the available troops of the IIIrd
Corps, and with equal promptitude General von Goeben
(commanding VIIIth Corps) hurried thither the entire
16th Division. Generals von Döring (commanding
9th Infantry Brigade) and von Barnekow (commanding
16th Infantry Division), belonging respectively to these
two Corps (IIIrd and VIIIth), had besides already
struck forward from Tudweiler and Fischbach in the
direction of the cannon-thunder, even before receiving
orders to that effect.</p>

<p>The position occupied by the French was one of
exceptional advantage. In the centre projected the
Red Hill (der Rothe Berg), a precipitous and almost
inaccessible cliff; and the steep slopes on either side
were densely wooded. On the left the massive buildings
of the Stiering-Wendel ironworks furnished a
separate defensive position.</p>

<p>Had the strength of the enemy been fully known
the attack would certainly have been delayed until the
whole of the 14th Division had arrived. As a matter
of fact, at the beginning of the fight, about noon, only
von François' Brigade (27th) had come up, and this
force, in the effort to facilitate an attack on the naturally
strong position held by the enemy's front, assailed
in the first instance both his flanks.</p>

<p>At first it succeeded in making progress. On the left
the 39th Regiment drove the swarms of hostile skirmishers
out of the wood of Gifert, but then became
exposed to the bitter fire of a French battalion lining
the farther side of a deep hollow. On the right flank
its 3rd Battalion, together with the 74th Regiment,
seized the wood of Stiering. But the enemy's superior
strength soon displayed itself in violent counter-attacks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and when Von Woyna's<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Brigade (28th) reached the
field it had to furnish reinforcements to both flanks.
Thus, at an early stage, intermingling of battalions and
companies began, which increased with every subsequent
rush, and made the control of the combat a
matter of extraordinary difficulty. Added to this was
the circumstance that three Commanding Generals in
succession came up to the scene of the conflict, and one
after the other took the chief control.</p>

<p>At about one o'clock, simultaneously with the
flanks, the Fusilier Battalion of the 74th Regiment
pushed forward in front, under a severe fire across
the open ground towards the Red Hill, and, under such
trivial cover as offered, established itself at the foot
of the cliff. When at about three o'clock the Prussian
artillery compelled the foe to move his guns
farther up the hill, the Fusiliers, with General von
François at their head, began to climb the cliff. The
French Chasseurs, evidently taken by surprise, were
driven from the most advanced entrenchments with
clubbed rifles and at the point of the bayonet. The
9th company of the 39th Regiment followed close, and
the gallant General, charging farther forward along
with it, fell pierced by five bullets. Nothing daunted,
the small body of Fusiliers made good its grip of the
narrow spur of the cliff.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a crisis was imminent. The 14th
Division was extended over a distance of about three
and a half miles, its left wing had been repulsed by
greatly superior forces in the wood of Gifert, its right
wing was hard pressed at Stiering. But now, at four
o'clock, the heads of the 5th and 16th Divisions simultaneously
struck in, shortly after their batteries, which
had been sent on ahead, had come into action.</p>

<p>The left wing, strongly reinforced, now again pressed
forward. General von Barnekow<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> led trusty succours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
up on to the Red Hill, where the Fusiliers had almost
entirely exhausted their ammunition, and drove the
French out from all their entrenchments. As the
result of a fierce struggle the Germans also succeeded
in taking possession of the western part of the wood of
Gifert. The right wing with sharp fighting had pressed
on to Alt Stiering and was approaching the enemy's line
of retreat, the Forbach highway. General Frossard
had, however, recognized the danger threatened at this
point, and reinforced his left wing to the strength of a
Division and a half. This force advanced to the attack
at five o'clock. On the German side there was no
formed force to oppose to it, so all the previously
gained advantages were lost.</p>

<p>If the 13th Division<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> had here struck in with a resolute
attack, the battle would have ended. This
Division after, indeed, a march of nearly nineteen
miles had reached Puttlingen at one o'clock, where it
was little more than four miles distant from Stiering.
When the fighting about Saarbrücken was heard it is
true that at four p.m. the advanced guard moved forward
to Rossel. It would seem that the roar of the
cannon was not audible in that wooded region; the
impression was that the combat was over, and the
Division bivouacked at Völkingen, which place had
been previously named as the end of its march by the
Corps Commander at a time when he was, of course,
unable to foresee the change in the situation.</p>

<p>The French offensive movement had meanwhile been
brought to a stand by the seven batteries in position on
the Folster height; the infantry then succeeded in
making fresh progress, under the personal leadership
of General von Zastrow.</p>

<p>The nature of the ground entirely prohibited the
twenty-nine squadrons of cavalry which had arrived
from all directions and were drawn up out of the range
of fire, from taking part in the action. The Hussars
tried in vain to ride up the Red Hill, but in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
incredible difficulties Major von Lyncker finally gained
the summit with eight guns, amid the loud cheering of
the hard-pressed infantry. The guns, as each one came
up, at once came into action against three French batteries;
but quite half of the gunners were shot down
by sheltered French tirailleurs, at a range of about 800
paces. A small strip of ground in front was indeed
won, but the narrow space allowed of no deployment
against the wide front of the enemy.</p>

<p>But effective assistance was coming from the right.
General von Goeben had despatched all the battalions of
the 16th Division not yet engaged, in the decisive direction
toward Stiering. While one part of these troops
made a frontal attack on the village, the rest climbed
from the high-road up the defiles of the Spicheren woods,
in a hand-to-hand encounter drove the French from the
saddle leading to the Red Hill, and pushed them farther
and farther back towards the Forbach height.</p>

<p>Even as late as seven o'clock on the French right
wing Laveaucoupet's Division, supported by part of
Bataille's, advanced to the attack and once more penetrated
into the oft-contested Gifert wood, but the danger
threatening the French left wing from the Spicheren
wood paralyzed this effort. By nightfall the French
were falling back over the whole plateau.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock, when their "Retreat" call was
sounding from the heights, General von Schwerin (commanding
10th Infantry Brigade) made sure of night
quarters by occupying Stiering, where resistance was
only quelled, at many points, after a hand-to-hand fight.
The advanced guard of the 13th Division advanced on
Forbach, but did not occupy it, having allowed itself
to be hoodwinked by some French Dragoons in
possession.</p>

<p>Apart from this, General Frossard had abandoned the
line of retreat by the so seriously threatened Forbach-St.
Avold road, and fell back with all his three divisions
on Oetingen. The darkness, and the impossibility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
handling large bodies of cavalry in such a country,
saved him from further pursuit.</p>

<p>General von Steinmetz ordered the reorganization of
the dislocated bodies of troops that same night. Some
of them had marched more than twenty-eight miles;
two batteries, arriving from Königsberg by rail, had
immediately set out for the battle-field. But it remains
that the Germans at no time of the day
attained the numerical strength of the enemy in this
engagement, which had been begun with insufficient
forces. Only thirteen batteries could be brought into
action in the limited space, and the cavalry remained
excluded from all participation. It was only natural,
under the circumstances, that the losses of the assailants
were greater than those of the defence. The Prussians
lost 4871, the French 4078 men. The fact was significant
that a considerable number of unwounded French
prisoners were taken in this early action.</p>

<p>In strong contrast to the comradeship and mutual
helpfulness displayed by the Prussian Generals, and the
eagerness of their troops to hurry into the fight, was the
strange vacillation of the Divisions in General Frossard's
rear; of which three, indeed, were sent forward to his
support, but only two came up, and that when the fight
was already ended.</p>

<p>It has been vehemently asserted that the battle of
Spicheren was fought in an ill-judged locality, and that
it interfered with more important plans. It certainly had
not been anticipated. But, generally speaking, a tactical
victory rarely fails to fit in with a strategic design.
Success in battle has always been thankfully accepted,
and turned to account. By the battle of Spicheren the
IInd French Corps was prevented from withdrawing
unharmed; touch of the enemy's main force was
obtained, and to the supreme Direction of the armies
was afforded a basis for further resolutions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Right Wheel of the German Army.</span></h2>


<p>Marshal MacMahon in his retreat had taken a
direction which entirely severed his touch with Marshal
Bazaine.</p>

<p>As he was not pursued, he could have used the Lunéville-Metz
railway to effect his union with the French
main army; for up to the 9th it was still open. But
rumour had it that the Prussians had already appeared
in Pont à Mousson, and the state of his troops did not
permit him thus early to risk another engagement.</p>

<p>His Ist Corps, therefore, marched southwards on
Neufchâteau, whence Châlons could be reached by railway.
The Vth Corps was being shifted to and fro by
contradictory orders from the Emperor's head-quarters.
First it was to proceed to Nancy, then to take an
opposite direction towards Langres. On arriving at
Charmes it was ordered to Toul, but from Chaumont it
was finally directed to proceed to Châlons. General
Trochu had there located the newly-formed XIIth
Corps, and behind this gathering point the VIIth Corps
also managed to get away from Alsace and reach Rheims
by rail by way of Bar sur Aube and Paris.</p>

<p>Thus by August 22nd a Reserve Army was formed,
consisting of four Corps and two Cavalry Divisions,
under the command of Marshal MacMahon, who, however,
at a distance, as he was, of about 120 miles,
was unable to render timely assistance to Marshal
Bazaine, who stood directly in the line of the advancing
enemy.</p>

<p>When the news of the double disaster of August 6th
reached the Imperial Head-quarter, the first impression
there was that it would be necessary to retreat
immediately on Châlons with Bazaine's army; and the
VIth Corps, a portion of which was already being
transported thence to Metz, was ordered to retrace its
steps. But this resolution was presently retracted.
The Emperor had not merely to consider the foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
enemy, but public opinion within his own realm. The
sacrifice of entire provinces at the very beginning of
a war which had been undertaken with such high
anticipations, would have provoked the unbounded
indignation of the French people. There were still
200,000 men who could be brought together in front
of the Moselle, supported by a large fortress, and though
the enemy would still have the superiority in numbers,
his army was holding a line nearly sixty miles long.
It had yet to cross the Moselle, and this would
necessitate a dislocation which might create a weakness
at the critical moment.</p>

<p>In the IIIrd German Army the disorderly condition
of the defeated enemy was not known, nor even the
direction of his retreat. It was expected that
MacMahon's Army would be found rallied on the
farther side of the Vosges for renewed resistance; and
as it was impossible to cross the mountains except in
detached columns, the German advance was very
cautious, and by short marches only. Though the
distance between Reichshofen and the Saar is not more
than about twenty-eight miles in a straight line, that
river was only reached in five days. Nothing was seen
of the enemy, except in the fortified places, small
indeed, but too strong to be taken by storm, which
command the highways in the mountains. Bitsch had
to be avoided by a fatiguing circuit, Lichtenberg was
captured by surprise, Lützelstein had been abandoned
by its garrison, the investment of Pfalzburg was handed
over to the approaching VIth Corps, and Marsal
capitulated after a short resistance.</p>

<p>The German left wing had no enemy before it, and
could be brought into closer connection with the centre.
To bring the three armies abreast of each other a wheel
to the right was requisite. The advance of the Ist and
IInd Armies had, however, to be delayed, as the IIIrd
did not reach the Saar until August 12th. The whole
movement was so arranged that the IIIrd Army was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
use the roads by Saarunion and Dieuze, and to southward;
the IInd those by St. Avold and Nomény and to
southward; the Ist those by Saarlouis and Les Etangs,
the last also taking the direction of Metz.</p>

<p>The cavalry Divisions which were reconnoitring far
to the front, reported the enemy as retreating all along
the line. They ranged close up to Metz, and across
the Moselle both above and below the place, forcing
the detachments of Canrobert's Corps, which had again
been ordered up from Châlons, to return thither. All
their information indicated that very large masses were
encamped in front of Metz. From this it might equally
be inferred that the enemy intended to retreat further,
or, with his whole force concentrated, to strike hard at
the right wing of the German Army, at the moment
when the impending crossing of the Moselle should
make its severance from the left wing unavoidable.</p>

<p>The chief Head-quarter restricted itself in ordinary
course to issuing general directions, the execution of
which was left in detail to the army commanders; but
in this instance it was deemed necessary in the
momentary circumstances to regulate the movements of
each separate corps by specific orders. On August
11th the Head-quarter of his Majesty was therefore
transferred to St. Avold, in the front line, and midway
between the Ist and IInd Armies, so as, by being in
the immediate vicinity, to be able to exercise timely
authority to either hand. The three Corps of the Ist
Army advanced towards the German Nied on August
12th, only to find that the French had evacuated that
position. Three Corps of the IInd Army on the left of
the Ist also moved forward in prolongation of the same
front by Faulquemont and Morhange, while two others
followed.</p>

<p>On the next day the IInd Army reached the Seille,
without encountering the enemy, and occupied Pont à
Mousson with infantry.</p>

<p>The strangely inactive attitude of the French made
it seem quite probable that they might not make any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
stand in front of Metz, a probability strengthened by
the reports of the German cavalry, which was scouting
as far as Toul and on to the Verdun road. But there
always loomed the possibility that the enemy would
throw himself with 200 battalions on the Ist Army,
now in his immediate front. The two Corps forming
the right wing of the IInd Army were therefore
ordered to halt for the present, a little to the south of
Metz, ready to deliver a shattering blow on the flank
of any such attack. If the enemy preferred to assail
these Corps, then would devolve on the Ist Army on its
part the prompt assumption of the offensive.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other Corps of the IInd Army were
pursuing the march towards the Moselle farther to the
southward; if the enemy should attack them with
superior forces after they had crossed the river, it
would be possible for them, in case of need, to fall back
on the IIIrd Army.</p>

<p>So much caution was not universally deemed
essential; it was argued that the French seemed
already committed to full retreat, they ought not to
be allowed to get away without punishment, and it
followed that the German Army should strike without
delay. The French had, indeed, already committed
themselves to a further retreat; but when in the afternoon
(of the 14th) the VIIth Corps discerned their retrograde
movement, a fight began on the hither side of
the Moselle, which, by the voluntary intervention of
the nearest bodies of troops, developed into a battle in
the course of the evening.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Colombey&mdash;Nouilly.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(August 14th.)</div>


<p>The Commandant of Metz had declared his inability
to hold that place for a fortnight, if left to his own
resources; but the chosen and intrenched position on
the Nied, taken up to cover the fortress, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
found locally defective, and the French Head-quarter
hoped to find a more favourable defensive position
in the vicinity of Verdun.</p>

<p>Military necessity outweighed even a politic regard
for public opinion, and the Emperor, although he had
transferred the command-in-chief to Marshal Bazaine,
still remained with the army, for it would have been
impossible for him to return to Paris in existing
circumstances.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning of the 14th August the
multitudinous trains were being withdrawn through
the city, and towards noon the IInd, IVth, and VIth
Corps got in motion, while the IIIrd Corps remained
in position behind the deep valley of the Colombey
brook, to cover the retirement.</p>

<p>When, at four in the afternoon, the break-up of the
enemy was perceived, General von der Goltz (commanding
26th Infantry Brigade) with the advanced guard
of the VIIth Corps struck him in the act, and wrenched
from him Colombey and the Château d'Aubigny on
his right flank. But, at the first cannon sound, the
French columns immediately turned about, fully
equipped for fighting, and eager, after their many
previous disasters, to break the spell by a desperate
effort. Castagny's Division threw itself in greatly
superior force upon the weak German detachment in
the isolated position of Colombey, which held its own
only by the utmost exertion.</p>

<p>Already the advanced guard of the Ist Army Corps
was approaching by both the high-roads from Saarbrücken
and Saarlouis; and its batteries having pushed
on ahead, at once took part in the engagement. Passing
through Lauvallier, the infantry followed close, climbed
the eastern slope of the plateau of Bellecroix, and
farther to the right drove the enemy out of the wood
east of Mey. But the presence at this point of the
main body of the French IIIrd Corps gave pause to the
German offensive for the time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The 13th, 1st, and 2nd Divisions had meanwhile
followed their respective advanced guards, the two
latter having been held in full readiness by General
von Manteuffel ever since his outposts had reported
that the enemy was moving. General von Zastrow,
too, arrived on the field, and took over the command
of the left wing. Soon sixty field-pieces were in action
against the enemy. General von Osten-Sacken hurried
forward the 25th Brigade through the hollow of Coincy,
and climbed on to the edge of the upland. The clump
of fir-trees on the road to Bellecroix was taken by
storm, was surrounded on three sides, was lost again in
a bloody conflict, and was once more recaptured. Soon
afterwards two batteries succeeded in establishing themselves
above Planchette, whose fire drove the French
back as far as Borny; yet still the conflict raged on
both sides with the utmost fury.</p>

<p>But now there threatened the German right the
danger of being out-flanked. General Ladmirault, on
learning that Grenier's Division had been driven out of
Mey, immediately set out to its support with his other
two Divisions, retook the village, and pressed farther forward
by the Bouzonville road. General von Manteuffel
had meanwhile given the necessary orders for holding,
at all hazards, the deep-cut trough of the Vallières
brook which covered the flank. The 1st Brigade was
posted behind Noisseville as general reserve, the 4th,
and part of the artillery of the Ist Corps, marched by
the Bouzonville road to confront General Ladmirault
near Poix, while the remaining batteries from the
southern slopes to the eastward of Nouilly enfiladed his
advance. On the left, Glümer's Division (13th) had all
this time been holding its ground at Colombey, and
now, at seven o'clock in the evening, Woyna's Brigade
came to its assistance, and took possession of the
copses westward of Colombey. A very welcome reinforcement
now arrived from the IInd Army remaining
halted on the Seille.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The 18th Infantry Division, after a heavy march,
had bivouacked near Buchy in the afternoon, but when
General von Wrangel (its commander) was informed
that fighting was audible from the locality of the Ist
Army, he promptly set his Division in motion in that
direction. He drove the enemy out of Peltre, and
then in conjunction with Woyna's Brigade occupied
Grigy, somewhat in rear of the French position in front
of Borny.</p>

<p>On the right wing of the fighting line, the 2nd
Division had also pushed on towards Mey, by way of
Nouilly and through the adjacent vineyards; and, as
darkness was setting in, that village and the adjoining
woods were wrenched from the enemy. The French
had not advanced beyond Villers L'Orme, and they now
withdrew all along their line from that village to Grigy.
The Prussians, as they followed up after dark, were
molested only by the fire of the heavy guns of the
forts, more especially Fort St. Julien.</p>

<p>The engagement of August 14th cost them the heavy
loss of 5000 men, inclusive of 200 officers; while the
French lost only 3600 men, their IIIrd Corps being
the heaviest sufferer. The vicinity of a great fortress
of course prevented the reaping of the fruits of victory
by an immediate pursuit. It was for the same reason
that a battle on the part of the Ist Army on that day
had not been included in the concerted plan of action,
though the possibility of such an occurrence had been
foreseen. Although it was true that but one Division of
the IInd Army (the 18th) had been able to hasten to the
aid of the Ist, and that after the late opening of the fight,
its assault on the left<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> flank of the enemy had not failed
of its effect.</p>

<p>The manner in which the battle originated rendered
unity of direction impossible.</p>

<p>It was but the advanced-guards of four Divisions
which were the troops principally engaged; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
daring attacks made on greatly superior hostile forces
by small bodies unfollowed by immediate supports
occasioned many critical moments, which might have
been dangerous if the enemy had pushed forward more
energetically in closely concentrated strength. But
while, for instance, his IIIrd Corps received no support
from the Imperial Guard standing close behind it, the
contrast presented itself that on the Prussian side, in
this as in the previous battles, there shone forth, along
with their ready acceptance of personal responsibility,
the eager mutual helpfulness of all the commanders
within reach of the battle-field.</p>

<p>An essential share of the success of the day must be
attributed to the artillery. Hurrying along in front,
leaving the responsibility of covering it to the advanced
guards which reached forward before the main bodies
of the Divisions had time to come up, it drove the
French completely out of their positions before Metz,
and back under the guns of the defences of the
place.</p>

<p>The protection so afforded to the enemy rendered
it impossible that the victory of Colombey-Nouilly
should yield any trophies, but the supreme Command
was quite content with the results obtained. The retreat
of the enemy had been arrested, and a day had
been gained for the crossing of the Moselle by the IInd
and IIIrd Armies.</p>

<p><i>August 15th.</i>&mdash;In the early morning of the 15th the
cavalry had ridden forward to the outworks of Metz, but
found none of the enemy on this side of the fortress.
A few shells scared away the Imperial Head-quarter
from Longeville on the further side of the Moselle.</p>

<p>As King William was riding over to visit the Ist
Army, immense clouds of dust were observed rising on
the further side of the fortress; and it was no longer
doubtful that the French had begun their retreat, and
that the IInd Army was henceforth free to follow
across the Moselle with all its Corps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ist Corps of the Ist Army was necessarily left at
Courcelles, south of Metz, to protect the railway, the
other two were brought up leftward towards the Seille;
and they were also by-and-by to cross the Moselle higher
up, so as to avoid interference from the fortress.</p>

<p>The French had started again on the retreat interrupted
on the previous day, but proceeded little more
than four miles<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> beyond Metz on August 15th. Their
cavalry only went somewhat farther ahead, by both the
roads to Verdun.</p>

<p>The IIIrd Corps of the German IInd Army crossed
the Moselle at Novéant, by the bridge which was found
intact, and by a flying pontoon bridge; its artillery,
however, was forced to make a détour by Pont à Mousson.</p>

<p>It was not until late at night that the troops were
all across and in bivouac close to the left bank. One
Division of the Xth Corps remained at Pont à Mousson
and the other advanced to Thiaucourt. The cavalry
scouted farther forward towards the Metz-Verdun
road, and struck in on the French cavalry near Mars la
Tour. Several small engagements took place, but
when early in the afternoon twenty-four Prussian
squadrons had assembled, the French retired on Vionville.
The Guard Corps and the IVth Corps crossed at
Dieulouard and Marbache, higher up the river.</p>

<p>The IIIrd Army advanced to the line Nancy-Bayon.
On this day an attempt to seize the fortress of
Thionville by surprise proved a failure.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Vionville&mdash;Mars la Tour.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(August 16th.)</div>


<p>In the Head-quarter of the IInd Army there was the
belief that serious fighting with the French was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
more to be anticipated on the Moselle, and therefore
two Corps, the IIIrd and the Xth, were ordered to
march on August 16th, northwards toward the road to
Verdun by way of Gorze and Thiaucourt, while the
other Corps were directed to advance by forced marches
westwards towards the Meuse.</p>

<p>The French retreat from Metz was, however, not
completely effected on this day. The trains blocked
every road, and in the forenoon three Divisions still
remained behind in the Moselle valley. The Emperor,
however, escorted by two brigades of cavalry, had
departed at an early hour by the road through Etain,
which was still comparatively safe. As the right wing
of the army could not yet follow, the prosecution of
the retreat was postponed until the afternoon, and
the left wing, which had already begun the march,
was sent back again into its bivouacs. But so early
as nine o'clock Prussian shells startled the troops from
their rest.</p>

<p>Major Körber had advanced with four batteries
close up to Vionville under cover of the cavalry, and
the French troopers, surprised by their fire, fled in
utter confusion through the camp of the infantry.
The latter, however, briskly got under arms in good
order, and the artillery opened a heavy fire. Destitute
at first of infantry supports, the Prussian guns were
withdrawn. Matters soon became serious.</p>

<p>General von Alvensleben, fearing lest he should fail
to overtake the enemy, had started again with the IIIrd
Corps after a short night's rest. The 6th Division
marched on the left, by Onville; the 5th, on the right,
followed the long forest valley on the way to Gorze.
This valley so capable of defence was found unoccupied
by the enemy, who indeed had taken very few precautions.
The advanced-guard presently encountered
Bergés' French Division on the open plateau south of
Flavigny, and General von Stülpnagel (commanding 5th
Infantry Division) soon discovered that he had before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
him an enemy whom it would take all his strength to
beat. At ten o'clock he began operations by sending
forward the 10th Brigade (commanded by General von
Schwerin); and opened fire with twenty-four guns.</p>

<p>Both sides now assumed the offensive. The Prussians,
on the right, fought their way with varying
fortunes through the wood, often in hand-to-hand
encounter, and, towards eleven o'clock, succeeded in
reaching the spur of the wood of St. Arnould projecting
in the direction of Flavigny. Their left wing, on the
contrary, was repulsed; even the artillery was in
danger; but the 52nd Regiment hurried forward and
re-established the fight at the cost of bloody sacrifices.
Its 1st Battalion lost every one of its officers, the
colours passed from hand to hand as its bearers were
successively shot down, and the commander of the 9th
Brigade, General von Döring, fell mortally wounded.
General von Stülpnagel rode up into the foremost line
of fire, inspiriting the men with brave words, while
General von Schwerin collected the remnants of troops
bereft of their leaders, and, reinforced by a detachment
of the Xth Corps from Novéant, carried the height
in front of Flavigny, whence the French presently
retired.</p>

<p>On the assumption that the French were already prosecuting
the retreat, the 6th Division had been ordered
forward towards Etain by way of Mars la Tour, to bar
the enemy also from the northern road to Verdun. When
it reached the height of Tronville, whence could be seen
how things really stood, the brigades wheeled to the
right in the direction of Vionville and Flavigny. The
artillery going on in advance, formed a formidable line
of batteries, the fire of which prepared the way for a
farther advance, and by half-past eleven the 11th Brigade
had taken possession of Vionville in spite of heavy
losses. From thence, and from the south, in conjunction
with the 10th Brigade, an attack was then directed
on Flavigny, which had been set on fire by shell-fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
The different detachments were hereabouts very much
mixed, but by skilfully taking advantage of every fold
of the ground, the individual regimental officers succeeded
in getting their men steadily forward, in spite
of the heavy fire of the hostile infantry and artillery.
Flavigny was taken by assault, and one cannon and a
number of prisoners fell into the hands of the brave
Brandenburgers.</p>

<p>Vionville, Flavigny and the northern end of the
forest of St. Arnould constituted the points of support
of the Prussian front now facing to the east; but this
front was more than four miles long, and the whole
infantry and artillery were engaged up to the hilt all
in one line. The second line consisted only of the 5th
and 6th Cavalry Divisions and half of the 37th Brigade
near Tronville.</p>

<p>The position of the French was one of great advantage.
Their left flank leaned on Metz, their right was
protected by formidable batteries on the old Roman road
and a strong force of cavalry; and so they could await
with confidence a frontal attack on the part of a
venturesome enemy.</p>

<p>The possibility of continuing the march to Verdun
on this day, under the protection of a strong covering
rearguard, was, no doubt, out of the question. Supposing
the Marshal earnest above everything to effect
his retreat, he could do so only by fighting hard for
his right of way, and by so freeing himself from the
enemy blocking his path.</p>

<p>It is not easy to discern, from a purely military
standpoint, why this course was not resorted to.
There was the full certainty that only part, and
probably only a small part, of the German host could
as yet have reached the left side of the Moselle, and
when in the course of the day the Divisions detained
about Metz arrived, the French had greatly the
superiority in strength. But it seems that the Marshal's
chief solicitude was lest he should be forced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
relinquish his touch of Metz; and he gave almost his
whole attention to his left wing. Constantly sending
fresh reinforcements thither, he massed the whole
Guard Corps and part of the VIth Corps opposite the
Bois des Ognons, whence an attack was exceptionally
improbable. One is tempted to assume that political
reasons alone thus early actuated Bazaine in his
resolve to cling to Metz.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Prussians slowly but surely made
their way beyond Flavigny and Vionville, and, assisted
by a heavy fire from the artillery, compelled the right
wing of the IInd French Corps to retire on Rezonville,
a movement which became a flight when the French
Generals Bataille and Valazé were killed.</p>

<p>To regain the lost ground the French Guard Cuirassier
Regiment threw itself resolutely on the pursuers.
But its attack was cut short by the rapid fire of two companies
of the 52nd Regiment drawn up in line, which
reserved their fire till the enemy were within 250
paces. The horsemen sweeping right and left rushed
into the fire of more infantry behind; 243 horses
strewed the field, and only the remnants of the regiment
wheeled about in swift flight, pursued by two
Hussar regiments which had dashed forward from
Flavigny. A French battery in front of Rezonville
had hardly time to discharge a few shots before it was
surrounded. For want of teams the Prussians could
not, indeed, carry off the captured guns; but the
Commander-in-Chief of the French army, who had
himself brought them up, was for several minutes in
imminent danger of being taken prisoner.</p>

<p>The 6th Prussian Cavalry Division had also been
ordered to the front. After passing through the line
of artillery and deploying as well as the limited space
permitted, it found itself face to face with fresh and
completely formed troops. Marshal Bazaine had taken
the precaution of substituting for the routed bodies
of the IInd Corps the Guard Grenadier Division,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
which he had at last prevailed on himself to bring up
from his unengaged left wing, but not without filling
the vacancy by a Division of the IIIrd Corps. Thus
the Prussian cavalry was received with such an overwhelming
musketry and artillery fire that it halted,
and deliberately retired, its retreat being covered by
two squadrons of Uhlans, which time after time showed
a front against the enemy. The cavalry had not
actually engaged, but its advance had gained time and
opportunity for the artillery to move further forward
in one line from the spur of the wood to Flavigny.</p>

<p>It was now two o'clock. So far General von Alvensleben
had deceived the enemy with regard to the
slenderness of his force by acting incessantly on the
offensive. But the battle was now at a standstill, the
battalions were visibly thinned, their strength was
sapped by four hours of hard fighting, and the ammunition
of the infantry was almost exhausted. Not a
battalion, not a battery remained in reserve behind the
fighting line standing there in the fire. It was now
required to conserve the success won with so much
blood by acting thenceforth on the defensive.</p>

<p>The left wing was in especial danger, being under
the fire of the powerful artillery deployed on the
Roman road. Their greatly superior numbers enabled
the French to extend farther and farther to the right,
threatening thus completely to envelop the Prussian
flank.</p>

<p>Marshal Canrobert, in the French centre, had discerned
the right moment to press forward against
Vionville with all his might. At this critical instant
there was on the German side only a small detachment
of the 5th Cavalry Division available to check this effort.
Two brigades had necessarily been sent to strengthen the
left flank, and of the 12th Brigade remaining in rear of
Vionville two squadrons had been detached to the
Tronville copses. The two regiments ordered to
undertake the task of charging the advancing enemy&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Magdeburg Cuirassiers and the Altmark Uhlans&mdash;were
consequently each but three squadrons strong, in
all 800 horses.</p>

<p>General von Bredow, commanding the 12th Cavalry
Brigade, first traversed in column the shallow hollow
sinking down from Vionville, then wheeled to the right
and mounted the slope to the eastward, both his
regiments on one front. Received immediately with
heavy artillery and infantry fire, he threw himself on the
hostile ranks. The first line is ridden over, the line of
guns is broken through, gunners and teams are put to the
sword. The second French line is powerless to resist
this vigorous onslaught, and even the more distant
batteries limbered up to drive away.</p>

<p>But the rapture of victory and the impetuosity of the
charge carried the handful of troopers too far, and after
a gallop of 3000 paces they found themselves surrounded
by the French cavalry, which attacked them
from all sides. There was no scope for a second charge,
and so after several encounters with the French horse
the brigade was forced to cut its way back through the
French infantry, whose bullets accompanied it home.
Only one-half of the command returned to Flavigny,
where it was reorganized into two squadrons. The
devoted self-sacrifice of the two heroic regiments effected
the result, that the French entirely discontinued their
attack on Vionville.</p>

<p>At three o'clock four of their Divisions advanced
towards the Tronville copses. Barby's cavalry brigade
(11th), watching the western verge, had to retire before
the enemy's fire, and the German infantry occupying the
wood also had to yield to a strength so superior; the
batteries which were in action between Vionville and
the copses were assailed in rear from the west through
the glades of the copses, and were likewise forced to
retire. But not until the lapse of an hour did the
French succeed in overcoming the obstinate resistance
of four staunch battalions.</p>

<p>At the subsequent roll-call near Tronville, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
ascertained that the 24th Regiment had lost 1000
men and 52 officers, and that the 2nd Battalion of the
20th Regiment had lost all its officers. The 37th
demi-Brigade, which of its own accord had been
fighting valiantly in support since noon, took possession
of the village of Tronville and prepared it
for an obstinate defence.</p>

<p>It was not till after three that the IIIrd Corps,
which had been fighting for seven<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> hours almost single-handed,
received effective assistance.</p>

<p>While the Xth Corps was on the march through
Thiaucourt, its advanced guard heard cannon-fire from
the direction of Vionville. The Corps Commander,
General von Voigts-Rhetz, immediately set out for the
battle-field, and having personally ascertained how
matters stood, he sent back the requisite orders to his
approaching troops.</p>

<p>In this instance again it was the artillery which,
hurrying on in advance, masterfully struck into the
conflict. Its fire, in conjunction with that of the
promptly further advancing batteries of the IIIrd Corps,
checked the French rush made on both sides of the
Tronville copses simultaneously. At half-past three
the head of von Woyna's Brigade (39th) fell on, drove
the enemy back into the wood, and finally, supported
by Diringshofen's Brigade (40th), took possession of
its northern outskirts.</p>

<p>The right wing of the IIIrd Corps had also received
some reinforcement.</p>

<p>The 32nd Brigade of the VIIIth Corps, on being
called upon to assist the 5th Division, fatigued though
it was by a long march, immediately advanced from
the Moselle by Arry. The 11th Regiment joined it,
and three batteries were sent ahead to commence
operations; this force emerged at five o'clock from the
forest of St. Arnould. It at once made an assault on
the heights in front of Maison Blanche, but, though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
made three strenuous efforts in succession, failed to
carry them, since Marshal Bazaine had greatly
strengthened his position in front of Rezonville. Then
the French, in their turn, took the offensive there; but
were equally unable to establish themselves firmly on
the heights, swept as they were by the well-directed
fire of the Prussian artillery; and they had to withdraw
from the attempt. Petty struggles for this
position were renewed later on both sides, but those
spurts came to nothing because of the fire of the
respective artillery; and the fighting on the German
right became in the main stationary.</p>

<p>That on the German left two French Divisions had
retired before a few newly-arrived battalions, and had
evacuated the Tronville copses, can only be explained
by a report having reached Bazaine's head-quarters
that the enemy was coming in upon his right flank in
the vicinity of Hannonville.</p>

<p>The enemy referred to was Wedell's Brigade (38th),
which, while on the march in the direction of Etain
according to its original orders, had received counter-instructions
while halted at St. Hilaire at noon, to
hurry to the field of battle. General von Schwartzkoppen
(commanding 19th Infantry Division) decided
to march by the highway to Mars la Tour, in the hope
of falling on the enemy either in flank or in rear. But
the French meanwhile had extended their reinforced
right wing to the sunken valley west of Bruville, where
three Divisions of their cavalry were massed in position.</p>

<p>Thus when General von Wedell advanced to the
attack on both sides of Tronville, which the French
themselves had fired, his brigade&mdash;only five battalions
strong&mdash;found itself in face of the long deployed front of
the 4th French Corps. The two Westphalian regiments
advanced steadily under the storm of shell and
mitrailleuse fire till they suddenly reached the edge
of a deep ravine hitherto unseen. This, however,
they soon traversed, and were climbing the farther
ascent, when they were met by a murderous shower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of bullets from the French infantry which hemmed
them in closely on every side. After almost every
one of the commanders and regimental officers had
fallen, the wreck of the battalions fell back into the
ravine; 300 men were taken prisoners, having no
strength left to ascend the steep southern rise after
the fatigue of a twenty-eight miles march. The remainder
rallied at Tronville under the shot-torn colours
which Colonel von Cranach, the only officer who still had
a horse under him, had brought back in his own hand.
Seventy-two officers and 2542 men were missing
out of 95 officers and 4546 men&mdash;more than half.
The French followed up their success, but were checked
on the right by the headlong charge of the 1st Guard
Dragoons, which cost that regiment 250 horses and nearly
all its officers; and on the left by the 4th squadron of the
2nd Guard Dragoons, which attacked three times its
strength of Chasseurs d'Afrique.</p>

<p>But there now imminently threatened the charge of
a great mass of French cavalry, which disclosed itself
on the open plateau of Ville sur Yron. This consisted
of Legrand's Division and de France's Guard Brigade in
four compact echelons, overlapping each other to the
right. On the German side, all the still disposable
cavalry joined Barby's brigade, and the body thus made
up, consisting only of sixteen squadrons, was formed for
action in two lines west of Mars la Tour. Farther in
advance stood the 13th Dragoons, halted to receive the
Guard-squadron on its return from its recent charge.
The 13th galloped forward to meet the charge of
Montaigu's Hussar Brigade, which constituted the first
line of the French cavalry mass, and which broke
through the (over-wide) intervals of the Prussian
squadrons. But General von Barby promptly appeared
with the other regiments on the upland of Ville sur
Yron, where at a quarter to seven the cavalry masses
came into collision.</p>

<p>A mighty cloud of dust concealed the varying phases
of the hand-to-hand encounter of 5000 horsemen which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
gradually declared itself in favour of the Prussians.
General Montaigu, severely wounded, was taken
prisoner, and General Legrand fell while leading his
Dragoons to the assistance of the Hussars.</p>

<p>De France's Brigade allowed the enemy to approach
within 150 paces, and then its Lancer regiment rushed
impetuously upon the Hanoverian Uhlans; but the
latter outflanked it, and received unexpected assistance
from the 5th squadron of the 2nd Guard Dragoons,
which, returning from a reconnaissance, plunged forward
over fences and ditches and fell upon the enemy
in flank, while the Westphalian Cuirassiers at the same
time broke his front. The Chasseurs d'Afrique strove
in vain to hinder the enveloping tactics of the Hanoverian
Dragoons; the clouds of dust drifted farther and
farther northward, and the whole mass of French horse
drew away towards the wooded slopes of Bruville,
behind which there were still five regiments of Clérembault's
Cavalry Division. Clérembault permitted one
of his brigades to cross the valley, but the fleeing
Hussars and some misunderstood signals threw it into
confusion. It was borne back, and not until the French
infantry confronted the Prussian pursuers in the covering
valley did the latter desist from the pursuit.</p>

<p>The Prussian regiments quietly re-formed and then
withdrew at a walk to Mars la Tour, followed at a great
distance by part of Clérembault's Division.</p>

<p>This, the greatest cavalry combat of the war, had the
effect of making the French right wing give up all further
attempts to act on the offensive. The Germans
mourned the loss of many superior officers, who always,
at the head of their men, had set them a glorious
example.</p>

<p>Prince Frederick Charles had hastened to the field of
battle. The day was nearly at an end, darkness approaching,
and the battle won. The Prussians in the
evening stood on the ground which in the morning had
been occupied by the French. Though General von
Alvensleben had in the first instance been under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
impression that he would have only the French rear-guard
to deal with, he did not hesitate for a moment to
become the assailant when he found the entire French
Army before him. With his single Corps he maintained
the fight till the afternoon, and drove back the
enemy from Flavigny to Rezonville, a distance of more
than two miles. This was one of the most brilliant
achievements of all the war.</p>

<p>Thanks to the valuable assistance of the Xth Corps it
was possible to carry on the battle through the afternoon
on the defensive, but only by most resolute
counter-attacks by the cavalry, and by the unflinching
tenacity of the artillery.</p>

<p>It was clearly most unadvisable to challenge by renewed
attacks an enemy who still outnumbered the
Germans; which action, since no further reinforcements
could be hoped for, could not but jeopardize the success
so dearly bought. The troops were exhausted, most
of their ammunition was spent, the horses had been
under the saddle for fifteen hours without fodder; some
of the batteries could only move at a walk, and the
nearest Army Corps on the left bank of the Moselle,
the XIIth,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> was distant more than a day's march.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these considerations, an order
from Prince Frederick Charles's Head-quarter issued
at seven o'clock, commanded a renewed and general
attack on the enemy's positions. The Xth Corps was
quite incapable of answering this demand; and only
part of the artillery went forward on the right followed
by some infantry. The batteries indeed reached the
much-disputed plateau south of Rezonville, but only
to be exposed on two sides to the fire of infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and artillery. Fifty-four guns of the French Guard
alone, in position on the farther side of the valley, were
taking them in flank. The Prussian batteries were
compelled to retreat to their previous position, but
two brigades of the 6th Cavalry Division still pressed
forward. Scarcely able to discern in the increasing
darkness where lay their proper line of attack, they
came under very sharp infantry fire, and withdrew with
great loss.</p>

<p>Fighting did not entirely cease until ten o'clock. On
either side 16,000 men had fallen. On either side pursuit
was out of the question. The Germans reaped the
fruits of this victory solely in its results. The troops,
worn out by a twelve hours' struggle, bivouacked on
the victorious but bloody field, immediately opposite
the French position.</p>

<p>Those Corps of the IInd Army which had not taken
part in the battle, were on that day on march towards
the Meuse. The advanced guard of the IVth Corps on
the left wing was heading towards Toul. This fortress,
commanding a railway-line of importance to the further
progress of the German Army, was reported to be but
feebly held, and it was resolved to attempt its capture
by a <i>coup de main</i>. But the bombardment of it by
field-artillery proved quite ineffective. Bastions of
masonry and wide wet ditches made a storm impossible.
An attempt to batter down the gates by shot
and thus gain an entrance proved a failure. Finally
the undertaking was given up, and not without some
loss on the part of the Germans.</p>

<p>At the Royal Head-quarter in Pont à Mousson it
had become known by about noon on the 16th that the
IIIrd Corps was engaged in serious conflict, and that
the Xth and IXth were hastening up to its support.
The far-reaching consequences of this information were
recognized at once.</p>

<p>The French were arrested in their withdrawal from
Metz, but it was to be presumed as a certainty that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
they would again make strenuous efforts to force open
their interrupted line of retreat. The XIIth Corps
was therefore ordered to set out for Mars la Tour as
early as three o'clock next morning; the VIIth and
VIIIth Corps to stand in readiness at Corny and Arry.
The bridging operations were to be pushed with the
utmost vigour during the night. The Head-quarter of
the IInd Army sent from Gorze the order to the Guard
Corps to make a forced march to Mars la Tour, and
there take up a position on the left of the XIIth Corps.
The execution of these orders was facilitated by the
foresight of the Commanders, who had in the course of
the day received news of the battle which was being
fought. Prince George of Saxony at once placed his
Division on the march to Thiaucourt, and the Prince of
Würtemberg assembled the Infantry of the Guard in
its cantonments farther northward in readiness for an
early march.</p>

<p><i>August 17th.</i>&mdash;On this morning, at sunrise, the
French outposts were observed still occupying the
sweep of front from Bruville to Rezonville. Behind
them were noticed a stir and much noise of signalling,
which might be the indications equally of an attack
or of a retirement.</p>

<p>The King arrived from Pont à Mousson at Flavigny
as early as six o'clock. The reports sent in to headquarters
until noon by the reconnoitring cavalry were
somewhat contradictory; they left it uncertain whether
the French were concentrating towards Metz, or were
pursuing their retreat by the two still open roads
through Etain and Briey.  Preparations for the
offensive were nowhere observed. By one o'clock,
after a skirmish on the way, the head of the VIIth
Corps had reached the northern skirt of the Bois
des Ognons, over against which the French subsequently
abandoned Gravelotte. The VIIIth Corps
stood ready at Gorze, the IXth, IIIrd, and Xth remained
in their positions, the XIIth and the Guard
Corps were on the march. Seven Corps and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Cavalry Divisions could be counted on for the following
day; for to-day all attacks were forbidden.</p>

<p>In making the dispositions for the impending battle
of August 18th, two possible contingencies were foreseen
and had to be provided for. To meet both the
left wing was to be sent forward in a northerly
direction through Doncourt towards the nearest of the
routes still open for the retreat of the French. If the
enemy were already retiring, he was to be at once
attacked and detained while the right wing was
hurrying up in support.</p>

<p>In case the enemy should be remaining about Metz,
the German left wing was to swing eastwards and out-flank
his farthest north position, while the right was to
hold his left closely engaged until this movement was
accomplished. The battle, under these circumstances,
probably could not be decided until late in the day,
owing to the wide-sweeping movement of a portion of
the army. A peculiar feature of the situation was
that both parties had to fight with inverted front, and
sacrifice for the time their respective lines of communication.
The consequences of victory or defeat
would thus be greatly enhanced or aggravated, but the
French had the advantage of having as their base a
large place of arms with its resources.</p>

<p>A decision having been arrived at, by two o'clock
orders were published at Flavigny for an advance by
echelons from the left wing. The guidance of individual
Corps during the battle was to turn on the
reports which should be brought in. The King then
returned to Pont à Mousson.</p>

<p>As early as nine o'clock in the morning the Saxon
Cavalry Division had reached the Etain road to
the west of Conflans, and had reported no enemy
visible except a few stragglers. Still, this only proved
that on the 17th the French had not yet taken up
their retreat.</p>

<p>In rear of its cavalry the XIIth Corps arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
during the day in the vicinity of Mars la Tour and
Puxieux, and left of it the Guard bivouacked in the
evening at Hannonville sur Yron, in accordance with
order. The IInd Corps, which ever since it left the
railway had followed close on the IInd Army, reached
Pont à Mousson, and was ordered to march forward by
Buxières at four next morning.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Gravelotte&mdash;St. Privat.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(August 18th.)</div>


<p>Marshal Bazaine had not thought it advisable to
prosecute the march to Verdun now that the Germans
were so close on the flank of such a movement. He
preferred to concentrate his forces near Metz, in a
position which he rightly considered as almost
impregnable.</p>

<p>Such an one was afforded him by the range of
heights stretching along the western verge of the valley
of Chatel. Their face looking toward the enemy sloped
away like a glacis, while the short and steep decline in
the rear afforded cover for the reserves. Along the flat
crown of the heights from Roncourt to Rozerieulles, a distance
of about seven miles, were posted the VIth, IVth,
IIIrd, and IInd Corps in succession from the north;
for which distance there were available from eight to
ten men to the pace (Schritt). A brigade of the
Vth Corps stood near Ste. Ruffine in the valley of
the Moselle; the cavalry was in rear of both flanks.
In front of the IInd and IIIrd Corps shelter-trenches
had been thrown up, battery emplacements and
covered ways of communication constructed, and the
farmsteads lying out to the front converted into little
forts. To approach this (left) wing from the west it
was necessary to cross the deep ravine of the Mance.
The VIth Corps on the other hand was wholly without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
an engineer park; and it is indicative of the general
ill-equipment of the French that, for the transport of
the wounded to the rear, in spite of the enormous
trains, provision waggons had to be unloaded and their
contents burnt. This Corps was therefore unable to
construct fortified flank defences toward the forest of
Jaumont, such as would have given to the right wing
the character of formidable strength. This would undoubtedly
have been the place for the Guard, but in
his apprehension of an attack from the south the
Marshal held that Corps in reserve at Plappeville.</p>

<p>The King returned to Flavigny at six o'clock on the
morning of the 18th. All commanding officers were instructed
to send their reports thither, and officers of the
General Staff belonging to the Royal Head-quarter
were besides sent out in different directions to report
information as to the progress of the engagement.</p>

<p>The following were the initial dispositions. The
VIIth Army Corps, which was to form the pivot for
the eventual wheel to the right, occupied the Bois de
Vaux and Bois des Ognons; the VIIIth, which the
King had reserved at his own disposition, stood halted
near Rezonville ready to march to the north or to the
east, as might be required. The IXth Corps, on its
left, advanced towards St. Marcel, while the IIIrd and
Xth followed in second line. The Guard and XIIth
Corps moved in a northerly direction.</p>

<p>In consequence of the Head-quarter of the IInd
Army having ordered the XIIth Corps, although it
stood on the right,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> to form the extreme left, a serious
delay occurred from the crossing of the respective lines
of march. The Saxon troops had not entirely passed
through Mars-la-Tour until nine o'clock, and till then
the Guard Corps could not follow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile the advanced guard of the XIIth Corps
had already reached Jarny, and pursued its march as
far as Briey without encountering the enemy.</p>

<p>Before information to this effect came in, the conviction
had been reached in the Royal Head-quarter
that at all events the main forces of the enemy still
remained before Metz; there was, however, a difference
of opinion as to the extension of the French front, which
it was assumed did not reach beyond Montigny. The
Head-quarter of the IInd Army was therefore instructed
not to extend further northward, but to attack the
enemy's right wing with the IXth Corps, and push in
the direction of Batilly with the Guard and the XIIth
Corps. The Ist Army was not to begin its frontal
attack until the IInd should be ready to co-operate.</p>

<p>In obedience to those instructions Prince Frederick
Charles ordered the IXth Corps to march towards Verneville,
and, in case the French right wing should be found
there, to begin the action by promptly bringing a large
force of artillery into action. The Guard was to continue
its advance by way of Doncourt to support the
IXth as soon as possible. The XIIth was to remain
at Jarny for the present.</p>

<p>A little later fresh reports came in, which indicated
that the IXth Corps, should it proceed in the manner
ordered, would not strike the enemy on his flank, but
full on his front. The Prince, in the discretion of his
high position, therefore determined that the Corps
should postpone its attack till the Guard Corps should
have been brought to bear upon Amanvillers. At the
same time the XIIth Corps was to push on to Ste.
Marie aux Chênes.</p>

<p>But while these orders were being expedited, there
was heard from Verneville at twelve o'clock the roar of
the first cannon shots.</p>

<p>The two Corps of the left wing had, moreover, of their
own accord, taken an easterly direction, and the IIIrd
Corps moved up in rear of the IXth to the Caulre farm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>General von Manstein, the commander of the IXth
Corps, had observed from Verneville a French camp
at Amanvillers, which apparently lay in negligent
repose. From his standpoint it could not be discerned
that to his left about St. Privat great masses of troops
were in position. Thinking that in this camp he had
the enemy's right wing before him, he determined to
act on his original orders and at once take the foe by
surprise. Eight of his batteries at once opened fire.</p>

<p>But the French troops showed great alacrity in
moving up into their prepared positions. The isolated
initiative of the single Corps naturally drew upon it not
only the fire of the troops opposite to it, but also that
of the hostile Corps to right and left.</p>

<p>In the effort to find a location affording something
of shelter, the Prussian batteries had taken position in
a fold of the slope looking towards Amanvillers, and
facing to the south-east, where, however, they were exposed
from the north, on the flank and even in the
rear, to the fire of the enemy's artillery, as well as to
the massed fire of his infantry.</p>

<p>To meet this, it was necessary to send forward the
infantry battalions nearest at hand. They took
possession of the eastern point of the Bois de la Cusse
on the left, and on the right seized the farmhouses of
L'Envie and Chantrenne, and forced their way into the
Bois des Genivaux. Thus the front of the 18th Division
in action extended along a distance of 4000 paces.</p>

<p>It had to endure very heavy loss from the circumstance
that the French with their long-range Chassepôt
rifles could afford to keep out of the effective range
of the needle-gun; the artillery suffered exceptionally
severely. One of the batteries had already lost forty-five
gunners when the enemy's sharpshooters swarmed
forward on it. Infantry protection was not available
at the moment, and two guns were lost. By two
o'clock the batteries still remaining in position were
almost unserviceable, and no relief arrived till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Hessian Division reached Habonville, and brought
up on the left of the distressed batteries, five
batteries on either side of the railway, which diverted
on themselves to a considerable extent the concentrated
fire of the enemy. The batteries of the 18th Division,
which had suffered most, could now be withdrawn in
succession, but even in the act of retreat they had to
drive off the pursuers by grape-shot.</p>

<p>The artillery of the IIIrd Corps and the Guard also
came to the aid of the IXth, and those of the damaged
guns of the last, which were still at all fit for
service, were at once brought up again into the fighting
line. Thus there was formed in front of Verneville and
as far as St. Ail an artillery front of 130 pieces, whose
fire now opposed the enemy's artillery with conspicuous
success. Now that the IIIrd Corps was approaching
Verneville and the 3rd Guard Brigade had reached
Habonville, it was no longer to be apprehended that
the French would succeed in piercing this line.</p>

<p>The main body of the Guard Corps reached St. Ail
so early as two o'clock. General von Pape (commanding
Ist Guard Division) at once recognized that by
wheeling to the east he would not only not strike the
enemy on that right flank of his which had to be
turned, but would expose his own left flank to the
hostile force occupying Ste. Marie aux Chênes. This
town-like village, in itself extremely strong, and also
strongly flanked by the main stronghold of the enemy's
right, it was necessary to gain before making any
further advance; but, in obedience to superior orders,
the General had to await the co-operation of the Saxon
Corps.</p>

<p>The foremost troops of this Corps had already
reached the vicinity of Batilly, but it was still distant
from Ste. Marie more than two miles, so that its
batteries could not be pushed forward into position
west of that place until three o'clock. But as the
Guard had sent most of its own artillery to the support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of the IXth Corps the Saxon batteries were of essential
service. Ten batteries now directed their fire upon
Ste. Marie, and by the time its effect was discernible,
the 47th Brigade of the XIIth Corps came up. At
half-past three the Prussian and Saxon battalions
hurled themselves on the town from the south, the west,
and the north, with loud hurrahs and without returning
the fire of the enemy. The French were driven
from it with the loss of several hundred men taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>The Saxons eagerly followed up, and north of Ste.
Marie there ensued a lively infantry fight, which
masked the fire of the artillery. The brigade having
obeyed the order to retire, the batteries immediately
re-opened fire, and the repeated efforts of the French
to recover the lost position were frustrated.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the IXth Corps succeeded in storming
and firmly holding the farm of Champenois, but all
further attempts by isolated battalions or companies to
force their way forward against the broad and compact
front of the French were then manifestly futile. Thus,
towards five o'clock, the infantry fire altogether died
out, and the artillery fired only an occasional shot.
The exhaustion of both sides caused for the time an
almost total suspension of hostilities in this part of the
field.</p>

<p>The Royal Head-quarter had firmly maintained the
resolution, that the Ist Army should not commit itself
to a serious offensive until the IInd had grappled with
the enemy. But when the day was half-spent and
when about noon heavy firing was heard from Vionville,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
it was to be assumed that the moment for action had
arrived; still, for the present, permission was only given
to the Ist Army to engage in the artillery preparation.</p>

<p>Sixteen batteries of the VIIth and VIIIth Corps
accordingly drew up right and left of Gravelotte on
the highway passing through that village. Their fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was ineffective, because they were too far distant from
the enemy; and furthermore they suffered from the
fire of the French tirailleurs nestling in the opposite
woods. It became necessary to drive those out, and
thus there occurred here a premature infantry fight.
The French were cleared out from the eastern declivity
of the Mance ravine, and the artillery line, now increased
to twenty batteries, was able to advance closer up to
the western brink and now direct the strength of its fire
against the main position of the enemy.</p>

<p>But the battalions of the 29th Brigade pushed the
attack further. They pressed on leftward into the
southern section of the Bois des Genivaux, but were
unable to obtain touch of the IXth Corps in possession
of the northern portion of the forest, since the French
firmly held the intervening ground. On the right
sundry detachments took possession of the quarries and
gravel-pits near St. Hubert.</p>

<p>The artillery meanwhile had gained the mastery over
that of the enemy, several of whose batteries were
silenced, and others prevented from coming into position.
The French fire was in part directed on the
farm-steading of St. Hubert, to the vicinity of which
portions of the 30th Brigade had spurted forward.
These formidable premises close under the face of the
enemy's main position, and in spite of a very heavy fire
therefrom, were stormed at three o'clock. The 31st
Brigade also now promptly crossed the ravine, but a
further advance against the farms of Moscou and
Leipzig, over a bare stretch of ground encompassed by
the enemy on its wooded edges, did not succeed, and
resulted only in heavy loss. On the extreme right, the
26th Brigade had taken possession of Jussy, thus
securing the connection of the German army towards
Metz, but found it impossible to cross the deep valley
of Rozerieulles.</p>

<p>Everywhere the advanced positions of the French had
been driven in, the farms in their front were blazing, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
artillery appeared to be crushed, and, as the situation
was viewed from Gravelotte, there needed nothing but
to follow up the success. General von Steinmetz
therefore, at four o'clock, ordered a renewed attack
with fresh forces.</p>

<p>While the VIIth Corps occupied the border of the
woodland, four batteries, backed by the 1st Cavalry
Division, moved at a trot through the ravine, about
1500 paces across, which lies east of Gravelotte. But
as soon as the head of the deep column came in sight of
the enemy he redoubled his rifle and artillery fire, which
had till now been kept under. One battery lost in a
twinkling the men serving four of its guns, and it was
only by an extreme effort that it was withdrawn to the
border of the wood; another never succeeded in deploying.
On the other hand, Hasse's battery remained in
action, in spite of the loss of seventy-five horses, and
Gnügge's battery stood fast near St. Hubert, regardless
of the return fire from the quarries.</p>

<p>The foremost regiment of cavalry bent to the right
at a gallop on leaving the hollow way, and advanced
towards Point du Jour, but the enemy, being completely
under cover, offered no mark for an attack. Clearly
there was no field here for the utilization of this arm,
so the regiments withdrew across the Mance ravine
under a heavy fire from all sides.</p>

<p>The result of the ill-success of this attempt was that
swarms of French tirailleurs now poured down from
Point du Jour, and drove the Prussian detachments
still remaining on the bare plateau backward to the
skirts of the wood. Chassepôt bullets even reached
the position of the Royal Commander-in-Chief and his
personal staff, and Prince Adalbert's horse was shot
under him.</p>

<p>Fresh forces pushed forward and drove the enemy
back into his main position. St. Hubert remained in
German possession, though the gunners of the battery
in post there were equal to the service of but one gun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
But all partial attempts to advance over the exposed
plateau proved a failure; and here also at about five
o'clock in the afternoon there occurred a lull in the
fighting, during which the weary troops on both sides
reorganized themselves and took breath.</p>

<p>About this time King William and his staff rode forward
to the swell south of Malmaison. But from there
nothing could be discerned of the situation of the left
flank of the army, at a distance as it was of more than
four miles. The French artillery had almost entirely
ceased along the whole front from La Folie to Point du
Jour; but to the northward the thunder of the cannon
fire roared louder than ever. It was six o'clock, the
day was nearly at an end, and it was imperative that
the decisive result should be precipitated. The King
therefore ordered the Ist Army to make a renewed advance
in support of which he placed the IInd Corps,
just arrived after a long march, at the disposal of
General von Steinmetz.</p>

<p>The battalions of the VIIth Corps which were still
serviceable, except five which remained in reserve,
were again sent across the Mance ravine, and in support
of them the battalions holding the Bois de Vaux advanced
in the direction of Point du Jour and the quarries.</p>

<p>The IInd Corps of the French Army thus assailed
was now reinforced by the Guard Voltigeur Division.
All the reserves were hurried up into the foremost line.
The artillery burst into redoubled fire, and a crushing
musketry fire was concentrated on the advancing
enemy. Then the French themselves took the offensive
with a huge swarm of tirailleurs, which hurled backward
upon the wood-fringes the small leaderless bodies
of German troops that had been lying in the shallow
folds of the plateau.</p>

<p>There, however, the sally found its limit; and there
still remained at disposition a fresh Army Corps in full
strength.</p>

<p>The IInd Corps, the last to come up by rail into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
theatre of war, had hitherto followed in the wake of
the army by forced marches, and had not been able to
take part in any engagement. It had started from
Pont à Mousson at 2 a.m. and, taking the road by
Buxières and Rezonville, arrived south of Gravelotte towards
evening. The Pomeranians expressed their eager
desire to get at the enemy before the day should end.</p>

<p>It would have been more proper if the Chief of the
General Staff of the Army, who was personally on the
spot at the time, had not permitted this movement at
so late an hour of the evening. A body of troops,
still completely intact, might have been of great value
the next day; but it could hardly be expected on this
evening to effect a decisive reversal of the situation.</p>

<p>Hurrying through Gravelotte, the foremost battalions
of the IInd Corps pushed forward to the quarries, and
up to within a few hundred paces of Point du Jour;
but those following soon found themselves involved in
the throng of the broken detachments remaining under
fire south of St. Hubert, and the further advance towards
Moscou was arrested. In the growing darkness friend
became indistinguishable from foe, and the firing had
to be broken off. Not, however, until ten o'clock did
it entirely cease.</p>

<p>It was, to be sure, an advantage that the fresh troops
of the IInd Corps were available to hold the foremost
fighting-line for the night, behind which the intermixed
detachments of the VIIth and VIIIth Corps were
enabled to reorganize themselves.</p>

<p>The whole course of the struggle had conclusively
proved that the French left flank, almost impregnable
as it was by nature and art, could not be forced even
by the most devoted bravery and the greatest sacrifices.
Both sides were now facing each other in threatening
proximity, and both in attitude to renew the battle on
the following morning. The result of the day turned
on the events evolving themselves on the opposite
flank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince of Würtemberg,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> then in St. Ail, had
judged at a quarter-past five that the moment was
come for an attack on the French right wing; but that
wing extended considerably further north than the
front of the Guard Corps reached; further, indeed,
than the French Commander-in-Chief himself was
aware. The Saxons had, indeed, participated in the
seizure of Ste. Marie aux Chênes, but after that event
the Crown Prince<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> deemed it necessary to assemble
his Corps in front of the Bois d'Auboué, before proceeding
to attack the enemy in flank. One of his
brigades had to come up from Jarny, another from
Ste. Marie; and, since the Corps had been delayed in
getting away from Mars la Tour, its direct attack could
not be expected at the earliest for an hour to come.</p>

<p>The 4th Infantry Brigade of the Guard Corps, in
accordance with orders received, proceeded in the
prescribed direction of Jerusalem, immediately south of
St. Privat. As soon as General von Manstein observed
this movement, he ordered the 3rd Guard Brigade, which
had been placed at his orders, immediately to advance
from Habonville direct upon Amanvillers. Between and
abreast of these two brigades marched Hessian battalions.
It was not till half-an-hour later that the 1st Guard
Division leftward of the 2nd moved forward from Ste.
Marie against St. Privat. This combined offensive
movement was directed against the broad front of the
French VIth and IVth Corps. Their respective strongholds
of St. Privat and Amanvillers had as yet hardly
felt the fire of the German batteries, which had hitherto
found enough to do in combating the enemy's artillery
outside the villages.</p>

<p>In front of the French main position on the crown of
the height had been prepared on the slope behind the
hedges and low walls, which rose terrace-wise backward,
tier on tier of shelter trenches. Behind these defences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
towered the village named St. Privat, castle-like with
its massive houses, which were garrisoned to the very
roofs. The bare slope stretching in its front was thus
exposed to an overwhelming storm of projectiles.</p>

<p>The losses of the Guard Corps marching forward to
attack a front so formidable were simply enormous.
In the course of half an hour five battalions lost all, the
others the greater part of their officers, especially those
of the higher grades. Thousands of dead and wounded
marked the track of the battalions pressing valiantly
forward in spite of their cruel losses. The ranks as
fast as they were thinned constantly closed up again,
and their cohesion was not lost even under the leadership
of young lieutenants and ensigns. As they drew
nearer to the enemy the needle-gun came into full
utility. The French were driven from all their foremost
positions, in which, for the most part, they did
not await the final struggle. By a quarter-past six
the battalions had advanced to within 600 to 800
paces of Amanvillers and St. Privat. The troops,
weary from the strained exertion, halted under the
steeper slopes offering some, though small, protection,
and in the shelter trenches abandoned by the enemy.
Only four battalions now remained in reserve at Ste.
Marie, behind the line which now extended to a
length of 4000 paces. Every charge of the French
cavalry and of de Cissey's Division had been steadily
repelled with the aid of twelve batteries of the Guard
Corps which had hastened up; but detachments
commingled under stress of untold losses, had to show
a resolute front against two French Corps in close
proximity for more than half-an-hour, before relief
came to them.</p>

<p>It was nearly seven o'clock when on the left of the
Guard, two brigades of Saxon infantry reached the
scene of strife; the other two were still assembling in
the forest of Auboué; their artillery, however, had for
a considerable time been maintaining a lively fire on
Roncourt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>When Bazaine received word that the Germans
were stretching out in constantly increasing extension
with intent to outflank his right, he at three p.m.
ordered Picard's Guard Grenadier Division posted at
Plappeville, to march towards the threatened flank.
Though the distance to be covered was little more than
four miles, this all-important reinforcement, having
diverged to rightward from the direct road through
the woodland, had not yet arrived; and Marshal Canrobert,
who was fending off with all his might the
converging masses of Prussian assailants, decided to
concentrate his troops more closely about the strong
position of St. Privat. The retreat from Roncourt
would be adequately covered by a small rearguard, since
the border of the Bois de Jaumont was being held.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that the Saxons did not find the
strong resistance at Roncourt which they had expected,
and after a slight skirmish entered the village together
with the companies of the extreme left of the Guard;
a body of Saxon infantry had previously been
diverted to the right from the road to Roncourt and
marched direct on St. Privat to the support of the
Guard.</p>

<p>The fire of twenty-four batteries of the two German
Corps wrought awful havoc there. Many houses were
set on fire, or crumbled under the concentrated crash
of the shells. But the French were determined to hold
to the last extremity this point, decisive as it was of the
fate of the day. The batteries of their right flank were
hurried into position between St. Privat and the Bois
de Jaumont, whence their fire would enfilade the
further advance of the Saxons on the former place.
Other batteries went southward to confront the Prussians,
and the simultaneous final rush of the German
battalions was met by a rattling fire from the French
riflemen under cover in their lines of shelter trenches.</p>

<p>All those obstacles were gradually overcome in the
course of the assault, although again with heavy loss;
some detachments halting occasionally for a moment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
pour in a volley, others again never firing a shot. By
sundown the attack had swept up to within 300
paces of St. Privat. Some detachments of the Xth
Corps, which had reached St. Ail, closed up, and now
the final onset was made from every side at once.
The French still defended the burning houses and the
church with great obstinacy, till, finding themselves
completely surrounded, they surrendered at about
eight o'clock. More than 2000 men were here taken
prisoners, and the wounded were rescued from the
burning houses.</p>

<p>The defeated troops of the VIth French Corps hurriedly
retired into the valley of the Moselle, their retreat
covered by the brigade holding the Bois de Jaumont
and by the cavalry. Only then did the Guard Grenadier
Division make its first appearance, and the Reserve
Artillery of the French Army deployed east of Amanvillers.
The German batteries at once took up the
fight, which lasted till late in the night, and in the
course of which Amanvillers was burned.</p>

<p>In that quarter the retirement of the IVth French
Corps had also already commenced, masked, however, by
repeated heavy attacks to the front. In the course of
these there occurred a hand-to-hand encounter with the
charging battalions of the right wing of the Guard and
the left of the IXth Corps. Amanvillers, however,
remained in the hands of the French for the night.
Not until three o'clock on the morning of the 19th
did the IIIrd French Corps evacuate its position about
Moscou; and the IInd Corps held its ground until five
o'clock, engaged in constant sharp frays with the outposts
of the Pomeranians, who on its withdrawal took
possession of the plateaus of Moscou and Point du
Jour.</p>

<p>The results attained on the 18th of August had been
made possible only by the battles of the 14th and 16th.</p>

<p>The French estimate their losses at 13,000 men. In
October 173,000 were still in Metz, consequently it is
certain that the enemy had at disposition in the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the 18th of August more than 180,000 men. The
exact strength of the seven<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> German Corps on that
day amounted to 178,818 men. Thus with the forces
on either side of approximately equal strength, the
French had been driven out of a position of almost
unrivalled natural advantage.</p>

<p>Naturally the loss of the assailants was much heavier
than that of the defence; it amounted to 20,584 men,
among them 899 officers.</p>

<p>Whereas by the war-establishment the average is
one officer to every forty men, in this battle one
officer fell to every twenty-three men; glorious testimony
to the example set by their leaders to their
brave men, but also a loss which could not be restored
during the course of the war. Altogether the six
battles fought in the first fourteen days of August had
cost the German army 50,000 men.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It was naturally
impossible immediately to call out at home a sufficient
levy in substitution for the losses; but reinforcements
drawn from the time-expired cadres were already
bespoken.</p>

<p>First of all that same evening the earliest instalment
of the trains and the Field-Hospitals had to be brought
up from the right bank of the Moselle; and the ammunition
had to be replenished throughout. In
Rezonville, thronged as it was with the wounded, it
was with difficulty that a little garret for the King and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
shelter for his General Staff were found. Its members
were engrossed throughout the night in preparing the
dispositions which the new phase of the situation
created by the victory rendered immediately necessary.
This exertion enabled all those orders to be laid before
his Majesty for approval on the morning of the
19th.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">New Distribution of the Army.</span></h2>


<p>The siege of Metz had formed no part of the
original plan of campaign; it had been intended to do
no more than merely to maintain an observation on
the place when the main army should have passed it on
the advance towards Paris; and a Reserve Division,
consisting of eighteen battalions, sixteen squadrons, and
thirty-six guns, detailed for that duty, was now near at
hand.</p>

<p>Under the altered conditions, however, the regular
investment of Metz was now necessary, and this
involved a radical alteration of the existing arrangements
throughout the whole army.</p>

<p>A separate army under the command of Prince
Frederick Charles, consisting of the Ist, VIIth, and VIIIth
Corps of the former Ist Army, the IInd, IIIrd, IXth,
and Xth Corps of the IInd Army, the Reserve Division
and the 1st and 3rd Cavalry Divisions, in all 150,000
men, was assigned to the duty of investing Metz.</p>

<p>The Guard, IVth, and XIIth Corps and the 5th and
6th Cavalry Divisions were formed into a separate army
under the command of the Crown Prince of Saxony;
it was styled "The Army of the Meuse" and was
138,000 strong.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>  This and the IIIrd Army, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
numbered 223,000 men, were directed to advance
against the new French army forming at Châlons.</p>

<p>Certainly the army investing Metz was left weaker
than the blockaded enemy. It was to be expected
that the latter would renew his efforts to break out to
the westward. Prince Frederick Charles' main forces
were therefore to remain on the left bank of the
Moselle.</p>

<p>All these orders received the approval of the King,
and were dispatched to the commanding officers by
eleven o'clock on the morning of the 19th.</p>

<p>In accordance with the orders of Prince Frederick
Charles, the Xth Corps occupied the woodland districts
of the lower Moselle as far as St. Privat, while the IInd
held the high ridge from that point to Moscou. To the
right of the IInd, the VIIIth and VIIth Corps followed
on, the latter positioned on both sides of the Upper
Moselle. The Ist Corps occupied the Pouilly upland to
left and right of the Seille, specially charged to protect
the great magazines which were being established at
Remilly and Pont à Mousson. The 3rd Reserve
Division moved to the vicinity of Retonfay, north-east
of Metz. The IXth and IIIrd Corps cantoned at
St. Marie and Verneville as reserve. All the troops
immediately set about the construction of earthworks,
and of bridges over the Moselle above and below the
fortress.</p>

<p>Of the Corps now belonging to the Army of the Meuse,
the XIIth assembled at Conflans and the Guards at Mars
la Tour; the IVth Corps, which had not been ordered
to Metz, had already reached Commercy.</p>

<p>The IIIrd Army, after crossing the Vosges range, and
having left a Bavarian brigade blockading Toul, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
pressing forward in three columns. Its foremost Corps
had already reached the Meuse, but were obliged to halt
there for two days, so as to cross the river approximately
abreast of the Meuse army. Its cavalry meanwhile
patrolled three marches ahead as far as Châlons and
Vitry, where, for the first time since Wörth, it regained
touch of the enemy. The French encountered were
only guarding posts on the Marne railway-line, which
retired when the traffic thereon ceased.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> These figures are erroneous. It is manifest that three Corps and
two Cavalry Divisions, most of which had been materially weakened by
casualties, could not furnish a strength of 138,000 men; nor could
the IIIrd Army, originally 130,000 strong, swelled by one Corps and
diminished by battle losses of 12,000, approximate a strength of
223,000. As a matter of fact, on August 22nd, the Meuse Army was
86,275 strong, and the IIIrd Army 137,622; the two armies together
had a total strength, in round numbers, of 224,000 men.</p></div>
</div>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">The Army of Châlons.</span></h2>


<p>Meanwhile at Châlons there had been formed a French
army of 166 battalions, 100 squadrons, and 380 guns,
consisting of the Ist, Vth, VIIth, and XIIth Corps.</p>

<p>Of the last the Division which had been left behind
on the Spanish frontier formed the nucleus, to which
was added a body of very superior troops, consisting of
four regiments of marines; later the two cavalry divisions
also joined. General Trochu, who had been made Governor
of Paris, had taken back with him thither eighteen
battalions of Gardes-Mobiles, they having already given
such proofs of insubordination that it was thought unsafe
to confront them with the enemy.</p>

<p>The Emperor had arrived in Châlons and had placed
Marshal MacMahon in command of the newly-formed
army. In the French Head-quarter it was not unnaturally
assumed that Marshal Bazaine was in retreat
from Metz. By an advance of the Army of Châlons
merely to Verdun the armies could form a junction with
each other in the course of a few days, and so a fighting
force be formed which might make head against
the hitherto victorious enemy. On the other hand,
MacMahon had to concern himself with the duty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
covering Paris, and that capital, no less than his own
right flank, was threatened by the appearance of the
Crown Prince of Prussia's army on the Meuse.</p>

<p>For the attainment of a decision between advancing
and retiring, it was beyond everything necessary to
know the direction which Marshal Bazaine might have
taken.</p>

<p>On the 18th tidings had come from him, that he had
maintained his position in a battle about Rezonville,
but that his troops had to be supplied with ammunition
and supplies before they could renew the march.
From this it seemed only too probable that the communications
of the Army of the Rhine were already
threatened; and MacMahon determined to march on
Rheims, whence he could either reach Paris, though by
a somewhat circuitous route, or move in the direction
of the other army.</p>

<p>But when it became known that the Crown Prince
of Prussia's army had not even been near Metz, and
that Prussian cavalry had already appeared before
Vitry, the Marshal could not deceive himself as to the
danger involved in the latter alternative. With sound
judgment, therefore, he stood out against the order of
the Empress and the Ministry to undertake that enterprise;
he determined against it, and announced his
resolution to march to Paris. Under its walls he could
accept a battle with advantage, since the fortifications,
even in the event of defeat, assured a safe retreat and
precluded pursuit.</p>

<p>Further reports from Metz did not afford a clear
insight into the situation there. Also on the 18th,
"the army had held its position," the narrative ran&mdash;only
the right wing had changed front. "The troops
required two or three days' rest," but the Marshal
"counted still on being able to move out in a northerly
direction," and fight his way to Châlons by the Montmédy&mdash;Ste.
Menehould route, if this road was not
strongly held by the enemy. In that case, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
march on Sedan, and even by Mézières, in order to
reach Châlons.</p>

<p>Bazaine might already have committed himself
to the movement thus indicated, and therefore Marshal
MacMahon, who was not the man to leave
his fellow-soldier in the lurch, instead of marching
on Paris, set forth on the 23rd in the direction of
Stenay.</p>

<p>The suddenness of this decision caused all the preparations
for the undertaking to be left unexecuted.
At the end of the first day's march the troops reached
the Suippe late in the evening in pouring rain. They
lacked every necessary, and two Corps remained
entirely without food. The Marshal was therefore
forced to move his army further northward to Rethel,
where large magazines of provisions had been established,
and where the railway facilitated the bringing
up of stores. Even on the third day's march the army
had made little progress eastward. The left wing
remained at Rethel, the right reached the Aisne, near
Vouziers. On August 26th the main army was still
standing between Attigny and Le Chêne on the
Ardennes canal, while the VIIth Corps and a regiment
of Hussars lay in front of Vouziers for the
protection of the right flank.</p>

<p>While the French army was thus marching eastward
by a wide détour, the German forces, which had been put
in motion at the same time, were for their part marching
due westward.</p>

<p>According to orders issued from the supreme Head-quarter
at Pont à Mousson, the advance on the enemy,
supposed to be at Châlons, was to be effected in such
manner that the IIIrd Army, marching on the left of
the Army of the Meuse, should have the start by a
day's march, so that the enemy, wherever he might
stand halted, could be struck simultaneously in front and
on his right flank, and thus forced away northward from
the direction of Paris. The two armies were to converge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
as they advanced, and to reach the line of Ste. Menehould&mdash;Vitry
on the 26th.</p>

<p>On the first day's march, the armies still on a front
some fifty-six miles long, the Meuse was reached; on
the second day, the 24th, they advanced to the line
St. Dizier&mdash;Bar le Duc&mdash;Verdun. The attempts to
take the latter place and Toul in the by-going proved
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>So early as on that day the 4th Cavalry Division,
which had pushed far ahead, sent in important news.
The Rhenish dragoons had found Châlons and the
camp at Mourmelon deserted, and notwithstanding the
destruction effected, there still remained in the latter
considerable booty. An intercepted letter written by a
French officer, which intimated that the relief of Metz
was in prospect, and another which stated that Marshal
MacMahon was at Rheims with 150,000 men and was
fortifying his position there, were corroborated by the
Paris newspapers.</p>

<p>On the 25th the Army of the Meuse formed a line
from Sommeille to Dombasle, while the heads of
columns of the IIIrd Army were already executing
the march prescribed for the following day, on the
Ste. Menehould&mdash;Vitry road. The small fortress of
Vitry, a few hours after a battalion of Mobiles had
left the place, surrendered to the 4th Cavalry Division.
On its march to Ste. Menehould, thence to be forwarded
by train to Paris, this battalion, 1000 strong, fell into
the hands of the 6th Cavalry Division as it was moving
on Dampierre, and was carried away captive.</p>

<p>The 5th Cavalry Division reached Ste. Menehould,
and the 12th followed on the same road as far as
Clermont, patrolling the country up to Varennes,
within nine miles of the French outposts at Grand Pré,
but without learning anything as to the whereabouts of
the French army.</p>

<p>The scouting service to any great distance on the
right of the army was hindered by the vicinity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
forest of Argonnes, which it was difficult for the
cavalry to penetrate without the assistance of infantry.
The inhabitants of the country began to show themselves
extremely hostile. The Government had
provided them with arms, and organized a general
rising. The Germans, who hitherto had made war on
the Emperor alone, were now forced to use their arms
against the population. The franctireurs, though
not affecting operations on a large scale, were a
source of much annoyance to the smaller undertakings,
and as it naturally embittered the soldiers to realize that
they were no longer safe either by day or night, the
character of the war became more stern, and the
sufferings of the country were increased.</p>

<p>A Paris telegram, sent by way of London, reached
this day (25th) the Royal Head-quarter at Bar le Duc.
It stated that MacMahon was at Rheims, and sought
to effect a junction with Bazaine.</p>

<p>It is always a serious matter to exchange, without the
most pressing necessity, a once-settled and well-devised
plan for a new and unprepared scheme. It would have
been unwise and unskilful hastily to alter the whole
direction of the advance because of rumours and
information which might later probably turn out to be
unfounded. Endless difficulties must result from such
a course; the arrangements for bringing up baggage
and reinforcements would have to be cancelled, and
aimless marches might impair the confidence of the
troops in their commanders.</p>

<p>The orders for the following day, issued at eleven
o'clock in the morning, prescribed therefore for both
armies merely a slight alteration of direction; Rheims
instead of Châlons was indicated as the objective. The
cavalry of the right wing, however, was explicitly
ordered to advance to Buzancy and Vouziers, where a
thorough insight into the situation could not but be
obtained.</p>

<p>In war it is for the most part with probabilities only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that the strategist can reckon; and the probability, as a
rule, is that the enemy will do the right thing. Such a
course could not be anticipated as that the French army
would uncover Paris and march along the Belgian
frontier to Metz. Such a move seemed strange, and indeed
somewhat venturesome; but nevertheless it was
possible. The chief of the General Staff, therefore, that
same day worked out a tabular detail of marches, upon
which the three Corps of the Army of the Meuse, together
with the two Bavarian Corps which were nearest that
army, could be brought together in the vicinity of Damvillers,
on the right bank of the Meuse, in three not
over-severe marches.</p>

<p>These forces, with the two Corps standing in reserve
at Metz, which could be brought up, would constitute
a force of 150,000 men, which might give battle in
the specified vicinity, or compel the enemy to do so on
the march to Longuyon. Without employing this
reserve, there was every prospect that the advance of
the French could be brought to a halt on this side of the
Meuse, and then another Corps of the IIIrd Army
could be brought up.</p>

<p>This march-table was soon to be brought into service.
Fresh news arrived in the course of the same afternoon.
The newspapers revealed the secret by publishing vehement
speeches delivered in the National Assembly to
the effect "that the French general who should leave
his comrade in the lurch, deserved the execration of the
country." It would be a disgrace, it was protested, to
the French nation if the brave Bazaine were left unsuccoured:
from all this, and considering the effect of
such phrases on the French, it was to be expected
that military considerations would give way to political.
A telegram from London, quoting the Paris
<i>Temps</i>, stated that MacMahon had suddenly resolved
to hasten to the assistance of Bazaine, though the
abandonment of the road to Paris endangered the
safety of France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The King, before night, approved of the march to the
right, and the orders were dispatched that night direct
to the respective Army Corps on the march.</p>

<p>On the 26th his Majesty moved his head-quarter
to Clermont. The Crown Prince of Saxony had set
out for Varennes early in the morning with the XIIth
Corps, and had ordered the Guards to Dombasle, the
IVth Corps to Fleury.</p>

<p>The cavalry, sent forward in every direction, found
that the enemy had evacuated the region of the Suippe
valley and had not yet entered that of the Meuse; that
Buzancy and Grand Pré were in occupation of the
French, and that a large encampment of their VIIth
Corps had been specifically perceived on the height
of Vouziers. The apparition of a few handsful of
cavalry, despatched thither on observation duty, occasioned
an almost unaccountable excitement. General
Douay, quartered at Vouziers, received the most
exaggerated reports, and must have thought that
a general attack by the German army was imminent.
The VIIth Corps was kept under arms the entire
night in pouring rain, and the Marshal resolved to
advance towards Vouziers and Buzancy with all his
forces on the following morning. Thus the march
to the east received a check as early as the 27th, but
the untruthfulness of the reports very soon became
sufficiently apparent.</p>

<p>If the German chiefs were deeply interested in gaining
an insight into the enemy's movements, so on the
French side this requisite was certainly urgent in no
less imperative degree. With judicious disposal of their
cavalry on the right flank, a surprise like that above
mentioned would have been impossible, but the 1st
French Cavalry Division was placed on the left flank,
where there was no danger whatever, and the 2nd was
rearmost of everything. It seemed as though in the
French army less attention was paid to the repulse
of an attack than to the evasion of one, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the unobserved attainment of Montmédy, the point
of rendezvous with the other army. When the
movement of the Germans from southward could no
longer be doubted, it would certainly have been best
for the French to take the vigorous offensive in that
direction with intent to defeat them, or at least to
sweep them out of the vicinity of their own line of
march. If they had failed in this they would, at any
rate, have readily learnt that their undertaking was
impracticable, and that its further prosecution must
certainly result in a catastrophe. It must, however,
be admitted that the German cavalry formed an
almost impenetrable screen. The Marshal could not
know that his enemy was écheloned from Vitry to
Varennes, a distance of more than thirty-seven miles,
and was not at all in form to attack him just then in
serious earnest.</p>

<p><i>August 27th.</i>&mdash;The Marshal had cleared up his misconception,
and on the 27th he continued his march, at
least with part of his troops. The VIIth and Vth Corps
covered the movement at Vouziers and Buzancy, the
XIIth advanced to Le Chêne, and the 1st Cavalry
Division to Beaumont, probably to ascertain the
whereabouts of Marshal Bazaine. The Ist Corps
and the 2nd Cavalry Division remained behind on the
Aisne.</p>

<p>The Saxon Corps, the furthest forward of the German
Army, had received direct orders to march to Dun on
the 27th, and secure on the right bank the passages
over the Meuse, as far as Stenay. It reached Stenay
at three o'clock in the afternoon, and threw forward a
post on the left bank.</p>

<p>The cavalry clung closely to the enemy and followed
his movements, often engaging in petty skirmishes.
The departure of the Vth French Corps from Buzancy
in the direction of Le Chêne was at once detected, as
also was the march to Beaumont; and the Saxon
Cavalry Division pushed forward that evening to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Nouart. The Bavarian Corps reached the Clermont-Verdun
road, the 5th Ste. Menehould; the other Corps
of the IIIrd Army were hurrying by forced marches
in a northerly direction.</p>

<p>The prospect now seemed certain that the enemy
would be overtaken on the left bank of the Meuse.
Word was sent to the blockading army before Metz
that the two Corps asked for were no longer required,
but they had already set out.</p>

<p>The latest dispositions made by Marshal MacMahon
clearly betokened a last effort on his part to persevere
in the original direction. He was écheloned along the
northernmost of the roads by which he could reach Metz,
but had left a strong reserve on the Aisne on which he
might fall back. When he now learnt that nothing had
been seen of the Army of the Rhine at Montmédy, but
that it actually was still at Metz, he resolved on retreating,
and, after giving orders to that effect for the
following morning, reported his intention to Paris.</p>

<p>From thence during the night came the most
strenuous remonstrances. The Minister of War telegraphed,
"If you leave Bazaine in the lurch, the revolution
will break out," and the Council of Ministers
issued a peremptory order to relieve Metz. The troops
in front of the Marshal, it was urged, were nothing
more than part of the army investing Metz; he had the
start of the Crown Prince of Prussia by several days'
march; and General Vinoy had already left Paris for
Rheims with the newly-formed XIIIth Corps as a reinforcement
to him.</p>

<p>The Marshal silenced his military convictions and
issued new orders. But the troops had started in
advance of the promulgation of them. The change of
route gave rise to much confusion; the roads were
bad, and quarters for the night were not reached until
darkness had long set in; the men were weary, wet to
the skin, and depressed in spirits.</p>

<p><i>August 28th.</i>&mdash;Little more than nine miles' distance
eastward was attained. The XIIth Corps reached La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Besace, the Ist was on the march to Le Chêne, the
VIIth was halted at Boult aux Bois because of a false
report that two Prussian Corps were occupying
Buzancy, further ahead. On the strength of this
report the Vth Corps moved toward that town by
way of Bar, but went on to Bois des Dames in the
afternoon. Neither of these movements was interfered
with. The German cavalry had strict orders, while
watching the French as closely as possible, not in any
way to check or press them, and the Saxon cavalry
evacuated Nouart on the approach of the enemy. The
Germans had to await the coming up of the IIIrd
Army, the rearmost Corps of which, the VIth, had only
just reached Ste. Menehould.</p>

<p><i>August 29th.</i>&mdash;For this day also a non-offensive
attitude was prescribed, and the bringing on of decisive
operations was postponed until the 30th.</p>

<p>The Marshal in his head-quarter at Stonne had been
informed that the Germans occupied Dun, and that the
bridges over the Meuse had been destroyed. He
had no pontoon-train, and could cross the river
only lower down, at Mouzon and Villers. His XIIth
Corps and 1st Cavalry Division passed over to the
right bank unhindered at these points; the Ist Corps
and the 2nd Cavalry Division proceeded to Raucourt.
The VIIth Corps, delayed on march by petty skirmishes
on its right flank, did not reach its destination
at La Besace, but went into bivouac at Oches.
The Vth Corps was to have moved to Beaumont, but
the staff officer carrying the order fell into the hands
of the Prussian cavalry together with his escort.
General de Failly therefore marched upon Stenay,
according to his original instructions.</p>

<p>Up to this time, apart from the cavalry, the Saxon
Corps alone had been in contact with the enemy, but
the Guard now came up to Buzancy in parallel line,
while the Saxon Corps crossed over to the left bank
of the Meuse at Dun. Its advanced guard at once
took possession of the wooded spur to the north-east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of Nouart, drove out the French cavalry, and
pressed ahead to Champy, where it encountered a
strong force in Lespart's Division. The purpose of the
reconnaissance having been attained, the advanced
guard was called in. The French Division, in consequence
of fresh orders received from the Marshal,
withdrew simultaneously in a northerly direction.</p>

<p>On the German side four Corps of the IIIrd Army
were now within nine miles rearward of the Army of
the Meuse. The 5th Cavalry Division stood at Attigny
on the enemy's line of communication; the 6th was
hanging on the heels of the French columns of march,
and, among other things, had taken Boncq with a dismounted
party. The Royal Head-quarter was now
advanced to Grand Pré, and, as the result of the various
reports which had poured in, the resolution was taken
to attack the enemy on the following day, before he
should cross the Meuse. The Army of the Meuse was
to march towards Beaumont, the IIIrd Army to move
forward between that place and Le Chêne. To bring
both armies to a parallel front, the right wing was not
to move until ten o'clock, while the left<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> was to start
before six o'clock. Only the trains absolutely requisite
for the battle were to follow.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Beaumont.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(August 30th.)</div>


<p>On the 30th of August, at ten o'clock, the King set
out for Sommauthe by way of Buzancy. Both the
Bavarian Corps were on the march thither, the Vth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Corps advanced in the centre towards Oches, the XIth,
together with the Würtemberg Division, was heading
for Le Chêne, the VIth for Vouziers. The IVth Corps
on the right was advancing by Belval, the XIIth
reached to the Meuse, while the Guard Corps followed
in rear as a reserve.</p>

<p>Marshal MacMahon had issued orders for the attainment
of the object that his entire army should
on this day cross to the right bank of the Meuse;
only the baggage trains and sick were to remain
behind.</p>

<p>His Ist Corps and the 2nd Cavalry Division had left
Raucourt so early as seven; they crossed the river at
Remilly, light bridges having been thrown over for the
infantry. The VIIth Corps at Oches had struck camp
still earlier at four o'clock, but as it took with it in the
march all its waggons, even the empty ones, the trains
formed a column more than nine miles in length, and
seven of its battalions were forced to march alongside
the road in the capacity of baggage guard; so that the
brigade bringing up the rear was unable to start until
ten o'clock. This long procession soon came into contact
with the Prussian cavalry, was fired upon by
artillery, and compelled to arrest its march. Not till
one o'clock could the movement on La Besace be
resumed, and then, as heavy firing was heard from
Beaumont, General Douay conceived it right to abandon
the road to Mouzon and take that to Remilly.</p>

<p>To the Vth Corps had been precautionally assigned
the duty of covering the march of the other two. The
troops had reached the vicinity of Beaumont only at
4 a.m., and were thoroughly exhausted by fighting
and the night-march. General de Failly therefore
determined to halt his Corps for cooking and rest
before pursuing the march. Precautionary measures
seem to have been altogether neglected, though it must
have been known that the enemy was now close at
hand. While at half-past one the officers and men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
engaged in their meal, Prussian shells suddenly burst
among these heedless groups.</p>

<p>The two Corps of the German right wing had to move
through a wooded tract in four wholly independent
columns, by ways sodden with rain. The Crown Prince
of Saxony therefore ordered that no single column
should attempt to enter on an attack before the neighbouring
one was ready to co-operate.</p>

<p>The IVth Corps had started very early, and after a
short rest had pursued its march at ten o'clock. When
at noon the head of the 8th Division emerged from the
forest, it discerned from its elevated position the
enemy's camp about 800 paces distant, in the condition
as described. General Schöler (commanding the
Division) held that the opportunity of so complete a
surprise was not to be let pass; the proximity of his
force could not long remain undetected by the enemy.
He announced it by his cannon-fire.</p>

<p>The Division soon recognized that it had drawn
upon itself an enemy of immensely superior strength.
The French rapidly got under arms, and dense swarms
of riflemen hurried to the front, whose long-range
Chassepôts inflicted great losses, especially upon the
artillerymen. The main body of the 8th Division had
meanwhile come up to the assistance of its advanced
guard, and ere long the 7th Division appeared on the
right. The French assailed it too with great impetuosity,
and could only be repulsed at the bayonet-point.
Presently, however, the foremost battalions of both
Divisions made their way into the French camp in front
of Beaumont, into the town itself, and finally into a
second camp located northward of it. Seven guns, of
which the teams were missing, and which continued
firing up to the last moment, a number of gunners,
waggons and horses, fell into the hands of the assailants.</p>

<p>Whilst now, about two o'clock, a pause occurred in
the infantry fight, fourteen batteries of the IVth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Corps engaged in a contest with the French artillery
deployed on the stretch of heights north of Beaumont.
The German artillery mass was presently strengthened
by the Saxon artillery on the right, and by the Bavarian
batteries on the left. This formidable and commanding
artillery line, constantly advancing in echelon, promptly
squandered the mitrailleuses, and at three o'clock the
remaining French batteries also were silenced.</p>

<p>The IInd Bavarian Corps, on the left of the Prussian
IVth, was advancing on La Thibaudine, when it was
quite unexpectedly attacked from the west by a strong
force of the enemy.</p>

<p>These troops were Conseil Dumesnil's Division of the
VIIth French Corps, which was continuing in march
to Mouzon in error, acting on its original orders.
Completely surprised as it was, and attacked in
front and flank, the Division gave up all hope of cutting
its way through, and at about four o'clock beat a hasty
retreat northwards, leaving two guns behind.</p>

<p>The Bavarians had in the meantime taken possession
of the farm of Thibaudine, and the Prussians that of
Harnoterie. The wooded hills prevented a clear view
of the surrounding country; the enemy had completely
disappeared.</p>

<p>General de Failly was making strenuous efforts to
collect his scattered forces in front of Mouzon, under
cover of a rear-guard halted at La Sartelle; and
General Lebrun had left behind on the left side of the
Meuse an infantry and a cavalry brigade and three
batteries belonging to the XIIth Corps, to render him
assistance.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the 8th Division, headed by the 13th
Brigade, was pushing toilsomely through the dense
forest of Givodeau, on its way to operate against this
new defensive position. On emerging from the wood the
battalions, which had fallen into some confusion, were
received by a brisk fire at short range. The repeated
efforts of the riflemen to advance were unsuccessful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and the dense underwood hindered the clubbed mass
behind them from forming. By the time the Saxon
Corps had succeeded with extreme difficulty in extricating
itself from the forest and swamps of the Wamme
stream, and had reached Létanne, the impracticability
of further progress in the Meuse valley became apparent,
since numerous French batteries, in unassailable
positions on the opposite side of the river, commanded
all the low ground. The Corps therefore ascended the
plateau, moved in its turn through the Givodeau woods,
and debouching thence swelled the strength of the
forces assembled on the northern border, where, however,
their development on a broader front was impossible.
So about six o'clock the infantry engagement
came to a stand for a time in this quarter.</p>

<p>On the left the 14th Brigade had come up into line
with the 13th, and this body (the 7th Division) was
followed by the 8th Division in two columns.</p>

<p>The 93rd Regiment had carried the height to the
north-east of Yoncq, and advanced in pursuit of the
enemy as far as to the foot of Mont de Brune. Four
mitrailleuses and eight guns, some of them with their
entire teams, fell thus into the hands of the Anhalters.</p>

<p>When, at half-past five, the artillery had come up into
position, and at the same time the 27th Regiment was
approaching, General Zychlinski (commanding 14th
Brigade) advanced to the enveloping attack.</p>

<p>The French occupied in strength the summit of the
entirely isolated hill; their batteries faced to eastward
against the Bois de Givodeau, whence an assault
threatened; but they swiftly changed front to the south
and directed a heavy fire on the 93rd and the 2nd Battalion
of the 27th, as they charged up on this face while
the Fusilier battalion was at the same time pressing
forward from the west. Regardless of their losses, the
assailants eagerly scaled the ascent, the brigade and
regimental commanders at their head. Six French
guns were seized while in action, in spite of a brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
resistance by the gunners and covering troops, and the
enemy was pursued as far as the Roman road. Here
four more guns, completely horsed, which had been
abandoned by the artillerymen, fell into the hands of
the conquerors.</p>

<p>The three battalions<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> hurried on towards Mouzon,
without waiting for the support of the<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> 14th Brigade
following in rear, but they suddenly found themselves
threatened by a cavalry-charge.</p>

<p>Marshal MacMahon had recognized the fact that the
only thing left him now to do was to effect as orderly
an evacuation as possible of the left bank of the Meuse;
the reinforcements sent across from the right had
already been recalled. The 5th Cuirassier Regiment
alone still remained. When, a little to the north of the
Faubourg de Mouzon, it was reached by the fire of
the advancing Prussians, the French regiment hurled
itself upon the enemy with a noble contempt for death.</p>

<p>The shock struck the 10th Company of the 27th
Regiment. The soldiers, without closing their ranks,
waited for the word of command of their leader, Captain
Helmuth, and then fired a volley at close range, which
struck down eleven officers and 100 men, the brave
commander of the band of horsemen falling fifteen
paces in front of his men. The survivors rushed back
towards the Meuse, and, as all the bridges had been
removed, they strove to gain the other side by swimming.</p>

<p>Considerable masses of the enemy were still in front
of Mouzon, and upon these the batteries of the IVth
Corps, as one after another they came into action,
directed their fire. Two Bavarian batteries brought
under their fire the bridge at Villers, lower down the
river, and prevented it from being used. Then the
suburb was carried after a fierce encounter, and here
too the bridge across the Meuse was taken and held.
The enemy, deprived of every way of retreat, received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
with a hot fire the 8th Division emerging from the valley
of the Yoncq, but was gradually driven back towards
the river. The French troops in front of the Bois de
Givodeau were also in a hopeless plight; they were
assailed by the 7th Division and XIIth Corps, and
were dispersed after an obstinate struggle. By nightfall
the French had ceased their resistance on the hither
side of the Meuse. Many lagging stragglers were taken
prisoners, others hid themselves in the copses and farmhouses,
or tried to escape by swimming the river.</p>

<p>In this battle, as in the preceding ones, the attack
suffered far heavier loss than the defence. The Army
of the Meuse lost 3500 combatants, the preponderating
loss falling on the IVth Corps. The French estimated
their loss at 1800; but in the course of the day and on
the following morning, 3000 prisoners, mostly unwounded,
fell into the hands of the victors, with 51
guns, 33 ammunition and many other waggons, and a
military chest containing 150,000 francs. And, what
was of supreme importance, by the result of this battle
the French army had been driven into an extremely
unfavourable position.</p>

<p>While the IVth Corps had been chiefly sustaining the
day's battle, the Saxon Cavalry had pushed forward
on the right bank of the Meuse, and had reconnoitred
towards Mouzon and Carignan. The Guard Corps
reached Beaumont, and General von der Tann with the
1st Bavarian Corps was at Raucourt, having marched
by way of La Besace with some slight skirmishing on
the way. The IInd Bavarian Corps was assembled at
Sommauthe, the Vth Corps had reached Stonne, the
XIth, La Besace. Thus seven Corps now stood in
close concentration between the Meuse and the Bar.</p>

<p>The King rode back to Buzancy after the battle, as
all the villages in the vicinity of the battle-field were
crowded with the wounded. Here, as previously at
Clermont, was felt the great inconvenience of inadequate
lodging for hundreds of illustrious guests and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
their suites, when, for once in a way for military
reasons, head-quarters were established in a small
village, instead of in a large town. Shelter for those
officers whose duty it was to prepare the necessary
orders for the morrow was only found late at night,
and with considerable difficulty.</p>

<p>These orders instructed that on the 31st two Corps
of the Army of the Meuse should cross over to the
right bank of the river, to prevent the possibility of
further progress of the French to Metz by way of
Montmédy. Two Corps of the army besieging Metz
were besides already posted in that direction about
Etain and Briey. The IIIrd Army was to continue its
movement in the northward direction.</p>

<p>As the situation had now developed itself, it already
seemed within sight that the Army of Châlons might
be compelled to cross over into neutral territory, and
the Belgian Government was therefore asked through
diplomatic channels to concern itself with its disarmament
in that event. The German troops had orders at
once to cross the Belgian frontier, should the enemy
not lay down his arms there.</p>

<p>While the Vth French Corps was still fighting about
Beaumont, and when the rest of the army had crossed
the Meuse, General MacMahon had ordered the concentration
of his army on Sedan. He did not intend
to offer battle there, but it was indispensable to give
his troops a short rest, and provide them with food and
ammunition. He then meant to continue the retreat
by way of Mézières, which General Vinoy was just
then approaching with the newly-formed XIIIth Corps.
The Ist Corps, which had arrived at Carignan early in
the afternoon, detached two of its divisions to Douzy in
the evening to check any further advance of the Germans.</p>

<p>Though any pursuit immediately after the battle of
Beaumont was prevented by the intervening river, the
retreat of the French soon assumed the ominous
character of a rout. The troops were utterly worn out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
by their exertions by day and night, in continuous
rain and with but scanty supplies of food. The marching
to and fro, to no visible purpose, had undermined
their confidence in their leaders, and a series of luckless
fights had shaken their self-reliance. Thousands of
fugitives, crying for bread, crowded round the waggons
as they struggled forward to reach the little fortress
which had so unexpectedly become the central rallying
point of a great army.</p>

<p>The Emperor Napoleon arrived at Sedan from
Carignan late in the evening of the 30th; the VIIth
Corps reached Floing during the night, but the XIIth
Corps did not arrive at Bazeilles until the following
morning. The Vth Corps mustered at the eastern
suburb of Sedan in a fearfully shattered state, followed
in the afternoon of the 31st by the Ist, which, after
many rear-guard actions with the German cavalry,
took up a position behind the Givonne valley. To
pursue the march to Mézières on that day was not to
be thought of. The XIIth Corps had that same
evening to show a front at Bazeilles, where the thunder
of their cannon already heralded the arrival of the
Germans. The destruction of the bridges there and at
Donchery was ordered, but the order remained unexecuted,
owing to the worn-out condition of the men.</p>

<p><i>August 31st.</i>&mdash;Of the army of the Meuse the Guard
and 12th Cavalry Divisions had crossed the Meuse
at Pouilly, and by a pontoon bridge at Létanne,
and swept the country between the Meuse and the
Chiers. Following close upon the rear of the French
and harassing them in skirmishes till they reached
their new position, they brought in as prisoners
numbers of stragglers. The Guard Corps then crossed
the Chiers at Carignan and halted at Sachy; the XIIth
pushed on to about Douzy on the Meuse,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> while its
advanced guard thrust ahead on the further side (of
the Chiers) as far as Francheval. The IVth Corps
remained at Mouzon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>The 4th Cavalry Division of the IIIrd Army reconnoitred
in the direction of Sedan, drove back the
French outposts from Wadelincourt and Frénois, and,
moving from the latter place, seized the railroad under
the fire of hostile artillery. The 6th Cavalry Division
on the left flank proceeded on the way to Mézières as
far as Poix.</p>

<p>When the Ist Bavarian Corps reached Remilly before
noon, it came under heavy fire from the opposite side
of the river, and at once brought up its batteries in
position on the hither slope of the valley of the Meuse.
A sharp cannonade ensued, by the end of which sixty
Bavarian guns were engaged. It was only now that
the French attempted to blow up the railway bridge
south of Bazeilles, but the vigorous fire of the 4th
Jäger Battalion drove off the enemy with his engineers,
the Jägers threw the powder-barrels into the river,
and at midday crossed the bridge. The battalion
entered Bazeilles in the face of a storm of bullets, and
occupied the northern fringe of the straggling place.
Thus the XIIth French Corps was forced to move up
into a position between Balan and Moncelle, where,
having been reinforced by batteries belonging to the Ist
Corps, it had to encounter, and that with considerable
waste of power, the daring little band of Germans.</p>

<p>General von der Tann<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> did not however hold it
advisable to commit himself on that day to a serious
conflict on the further side of the Meuse with a closely
compacted enemy, while his own Corps was still unconcentrated;
and, since the weak detachment in Bazeilles
had no hope of being reinforced, it withdrew therefrom
at about half-past three without being pursued.</p>

<p>Meanwhile two pontoon bridges had been laid at
Allicourt, without molestation from the French.
These and the railway bridge were barricaded for the
night, while eighty-four guns further secured them from
being crossed. The Ist Bavarian Corps went into
bivouac at Angecourt, the IInd at Hancourt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>To the left of the Bavarians the XIth Corps marched
towards Donchery, followed by the Vth. The advanced
guard found the place unoccupied, and extended
itself on the further side of the river. By three o'clock
two other bridges were completed close below Donchery,
whilst the railway bridge above the place, also
found unguarded, was destroyed.</p>

<p>On the extreme left the Würtemberg and the 6th
Cavalry Divisions came in contact with the XIIIth
French Corps, which had just arrived at Mézières.</p>

<p>The King removed his head-quarters to Vendresse.</p>

<p>In spite of a succession of occasionally very severe
marches in bad weather, and of being in regard to supplies
chiefly beholden to requisitioning, the Army of the
Meuse advancing on the east, and the IIIrd Army on
the south, were now directly in face of the concentrated
French Army. Marshal MacMahon could scarcely have
realized that the only chance of safety for his army, or
even for part of it, lay in the immediate prosecution of
his retreat on the 1st of September. It is true that
the Crown Prince of Prussia, in possession as he was of
every passage over the Meuse, would have promptly
taken that movement in flank in the narrow space, little
more than four miles wide, which was bounded on the
north by the frontier. That nevertheless the attempt
was not risked was only to be explained by the actual
condition of the exhausted troops; for on this day the
French Army was not yet capable of undertaking a
disciplined march involving fighting; it could only
fight where it stood.</p>

<p>On the German side it was still expected that the
Marshal would strike for Mézières. The Army of the
Meuse was ordered to attack the enemy's positions with
the object of detaining him in them; the IIIrd Army,
leaving only one Corps on the left bank, was to press
forward on the right side of the river.</p>

<p>The French position about Sedan was covered to rearward
by the fortress. The Meuse and the valleys of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the Givonne and the Floing brooks offered formidable
obstructions, but it was imperative that those outmost
lines should be obstinately held. The Calvary height
of Illy was a very important point, strengthened as it
was by the Bois de Garenne in its rear, whence a high
ridge stretching to Bazeilles afforded much cover in its
numerous dips and shoulders. In the event of a retreat
into neutral territory in the last extremity, the road
thereto lay through Illy. Bazeilles, on the other hand,
locally a very strong point of support to the Givonne
front, constituted an acute salient, which, after the loss
of the bridges across the Meuse, was open to attack on
two sides.</p>

<div class="center">(September 1st.)</div>


<p>In order, in co-operation with the Army of the
Meuse, to hold fast the enemy in his position, General
von der Tann sent his Ist Brigade over the pontoon-bridges
against Bazeilles so early as four o'clock in a
thick morning mist. The troops attacked the place,
but now found the streets barricaded, and were fired on
from every house. The leading company pressed on as
far as to the northern egress, suffering great losses,
but the others, while engaged in arduous street-fighting,
were driven out of the western part of Bazeilles
by the arrival of the 2nd Brigade of the French XIIth
Corps. They however kept possession of the buildings
at the southern end, and from thence issued to repeated
assaults. As fresh troops were constantly coming up
on both sides, the French being reinforced to the extent
even of a brigade of the Ist and one of the Vth Corps,
the murderous combat long swayed to and fro; in
particular the struggle for the possession of the Villa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Beurmann, situated in front of the exit, and commanding
the main street throughout its whole length, lasted
for a stricken hour. The inhabitants took an active
part in the fighting, and so they inevitably drew fire
upon themselves.</p>

<p>The fire of the strong array of guns drawn up on the
left slope of the valley of the Meuse naturally could not
be directed on the surging strife in Bazeilles, which
was now blazing in several places, but at eight o'clock,
on the arrival of the 8th Prussian Division at Remilly,
General von der Tann threw his last brigades into the
fight. The walled park of the château of Monvillers
was stormed and an entrance won into the Villa Beurmann.
The artillery crossed the bridges at about nine
o'clock, and the 8th Division was requested to support
the combat in which the right wing of the Bavarians was
also engaged southward of Bazeilles about Moncelle.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In this direction Prince George of Saxony<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> had so
early as five o'clock despatched an advanced guard of
seven battalions from Douzy. They drove the French
from Moncelle, pressed ahead to Platinerie and the
bridge there, and, in spite of the enemy's heavy fire,
took possession of the houses bordering the further
side of the Givonne brook, which they immediately
occupied for defensive purposes. Communication with
the Bavarians was now established, and the battery of
the advanced guard moved up quickly into action on
the eastern slope; but a further infantry support could
not at first be afforded to this bold advance.</p>

<p>Marshal MacMahon had been struck by a splinter
from a shell near Moncelle at 6 a.m. He had named
General Ducrot as his successor in the chief command,
passing over two senior Corps commanders. Apprized
of this promotion at seven o'clock, that General issued
the necessary orders for the prompt assemblage of the
army at Illy, in preparation for an immediate retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
on Mézières. He had already despatched Lartigue's
Division of his own Corps to safeguard the crossing
of the Givonne ravine at Daigny; the Divisions of
Lacretelle and Bassoigne were ordered to take the
offensive against the Saxons and Bavarians, to gain
time for the withdrawal of the rest of the troops. The
divisions forming the second line were to start
immediately in a northerly direction.</p>

<p>But the Minister of War had appointed General de
Wimpffen, recently returned from Algiers, to the command
of the Vth Corps in room of General de Failly,
and had at the same time given him a commission
empowering him to assume the command of the Army in
case of the disability of the Marshal.</p>

<p>General de Wimpffen knew the army of the Crown
Prince to be in the neighbourhood of Donchery. He
regarded the retreat to Mézières as utterly impracticable,
and was bent on the diametrically opposite course of
breaking out to Carignan, not doubting that he
could drive aside the Bavarians and Saxons, and so
succeed in effecting a junction with Marshal Bazaine.
When he heard of the orders just issued by General
Ducrot, and at the same time observed that an
assault on Moncelle seemed to be taking an auspicious
course, he produced&mdash;to his ruin&mdash;the authoritative
commission which had been bestowed on him.</p>

<p>General Ducrot submitted without any remonstrance;
he might probably not have been averse to be relieved
of so heavy a responsibility. The Divisions of the
second line which were in the act of starting immediately
were recalled; and the further advance of
the weak Bavarian and Saxon detachments was soon
hard pressed by the impact of the first stroke of the
enemy rushing on to the attack.</p>

<p>By seven in the morning, while one regiment of the
Saxon advanced guard had gone in upon Moncelle,
the other on its right had to concern itself with the
threatening advance of Lartigue's Division. With that
body it soon became engaged in a heavy fire-fight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
The regiment had laid down its packs on the march,
and had omitted to take out the cartridges carried in
them. Thus it soon ran short of ammunition, and the
repeated and violent onslaughts of the Zouaves, directed
principally against its unprotected right flank, had to
be repulsed with the bayonet.</p>

<p>On the left in this quarter a strong artillery line had
gradually been formed, which by half-past eight o'clock
amounted to twelve batteries. But Lacretelle's Division
was now approaching by the Givonne bottom,
and dense swarms of tirailleurs forced the German
batteries to retire at about nine o'clock. The guns,
withdrawn into a position at a somewhat greater
distance, drove back with their fire the enemy in the
hollow, and presently returned to the position previously
occupied.</p>

<p>The 4th Bavarian Brigade had meanwhile pushed
forward into Moncelle, and the 46th Saxon Brigade
also came up, so that it was possible to check the
trifling progress made by Bassoigne's Division.</p>

<p>On the right flank of the Saxons, which had been
hard pressed, much-needed supports now arrived from
the 24th Division, and at once took the offensive. The
French were driven back upon Daigny, with the loss
of five guns. Then in conjunction with the Bavarians,
who were pushing on through the valley to the northward,
the village of Daigny, the bridge and the farmstead
of La Rapaille were carried after a bitter fight.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock the Guard Corps reached the upper
Givonne. Having started in the night, the Corps was
marching in two columns, when cannon thunder from
Bazeilles heard afar off caused the troops to quicken
their pace. In order to render assistance by the
shortest road, the left column would have had to
traverse two deep ravines and the pathless wood of
Chevallier, so it took the longer route by Villers
Cernay, which place the head of the right column
passed in ample time to take part with the Saxons in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the contest with Lartigue's Division, and to capture
two of its guns.</p>

<p>The Divisions ordered back by General Ducrot had
already resumed their former positions on the western
slopes, and fourteen batteries of the Guard Corps now
opened fire upon them from the east.</p>

<p>At the same hour (ten o'clock) the 7th Division of
the IVth Corps had arrived near Lamécourt, and the
8th near Remilly, both places rearward of Bazeilles;
the head of the latter had reached the Remilly railway
station.</p>

<p>The first attempt of the French to break out eastward
to Carignan proved a failure, and their retreat
westward to Mézières was also already cut off, for the
Vth and XIth Corps of the IIIrd Army, together with
the Würtemberg Division, had been detailed to move
northward to the road leading to that place. These
troops had started early in the night, and at six
a.m. had crossed the Meuse at Donchery, and by the
three pontoon bridges further down the river. The
advanced patrols found the Mézières road quite clear
of the enemy, and the heavy cannonade heard from the
direction of Bazeilles made it appear probable that the
French had accepted battle in their position at Sedan.
The Crown Prince, therefore, ordered the two Corps,
which already had reached the upland of Vrigne, to
swing to their right and advance on St. Menges; the
Würtembergers were to remain behind to watch
Mézières. General von Kirchbach then indicated
Fleigneux to his advanced guard as the objective of
the further movement, which had for its purpose the
barring of the escape of the French into Belgium, and
the establishment of a junction with the right wing of
the Army of the Meuse.</p>

<p>The narrow pass about 2000 paces long between the
heights and the river traversed by the road to St.
Albert, was neither held nor watched by the French.
It was not till the advanced guard reached St. Menges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
that it encountered a French detachment, which soon
withdrew. The German advance then deployed against
Illy. Two companies moved to the right and took
possession of Floing, where they maintained themselves
for the next two hours without assistance against
repeated attacks.</p>

<p>The earliest arriving Prussian batteries had to exert
themselves to the utmost to maintain themselves
against the much superior strength of French artillery
in action about Illy. At first they had for their only
escort some cavalry and a few companies of infantry,
and as these bodies debouched from the defile of St.
Albert, they found themselves an enticing object of attack
to Margueritte's Cavalry Division halted on the aforesaid
plateau of Illy. It was at nine o'clock that General
Galliffet rode down to the attack at the head of three
regiments of Chasseurs d'Afrique and two squadrons
of Lancers formed in three lines. The first fury of the
charge fell upon two companies of the 87th Regiment,
which met it with a hail of bullets at sixty yards range.
The first line charged some horse-lengths further
forward, then wheeled outward to both flanks, and
came under the fire of the supporting troops occupying
the broom copses. The Prussian batteries, too, showered
their shell fire into the throng of French horsemen,
who finally went about in confusion, and, having suffered
great losses, sought refuge in the Bois de Garenne.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, the same hour at which the assaults
of the French on Bazeilles and about Daigny were
being repulsed, fourteen batteries of the XIth Corps
were already in action on and near the ridge south-east
of St. Menges; to swell which mass presently
came up those of the Vth Corps. Powerful infantry
columns were in march upon Fleigneux, and thus the
ring surrounding Sedan was already at this hour nearly
closed. The one Bavarian Corps and the artillery reserves
on the left bank of the Meuse were considered
strong enough to repel any attempt of the French to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
break through in that direction; five Corps were on
the right bank, ready for a concentric attack.</p>

<p>The Bavarians and Saxons, reinforced by the head
of the IVth Corps, issued from the burning Bazeilles
and from Moncelle, and, in spite of a stubborn resistance,
drove the detachments of the French XIIth Corps
in position eastward of Balan back upon Fond de
Givonne.</p>

<p>Once in possession of the southern spur of the ridge
sloping down from Illy, and while awaiting the renewed
attacks of the French, the extreme urgency was realized
of reassembling the different Corps and of re-forming
the troops, which had fallen into great confusion.</p>

<p>As soon as this was done, the 5th Bavarian Brigade
advanced on Balan. The troops found but a feeble
resistance in the village itself; but it was only after a
hard fight that they succeeded in occupying the park
of the château situated at its extreme end. From
thence, soon after midday, the foremost battalion extended
close up to the walls of the fortress, and exchanged
shots with the garrison. There now ensued a
stationary musketry fight with the enemy once again
firmly posted about Fond de Givonne. At one o'clock
the French, having evidently been reinforced, took the
offensive, after a preparatory cannonade and mitrailleuse
fire. The 5th Bavarian Brigade was driven back
for some considerable distance, but presently, supported
by the 6th, regained its old position after an hour's
hard fighting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Saxon Corps had extended itself in the
northern part of the valley against Givonne. There
also the foremost detachments of the Guard Corps were
already established, as well as in Haybés. The Prussian
artillery forced the French batteries to change their
positions more than once, and had already caused
several of them to go out of action. To gain breathing
space here, the French repeatedly tried to send forward
large bodies of tirailleurs, and ten guns were brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
up into the still occupied Givonne, but these were
taken before they could unlimber. The Prussian shells
also fell with some effect among the French troops
massed in the Bois de Garenne, though fired from a
long distance.</p>

<p>After the Franctireurs de Paris had been driven out
of Chapelle, the Guard-cavalry dashed through Givonne
and up the valley, and at noon the Hussars had succeeded
in establishing direct contact with the left flank
of the IIIrd Army.</p>

<p>The 41st Brigade of that army had left Fleigneux
and was descending the upper valley of the Givonne,
and the retreat of the French from Illy in a southern
direction had already begun. The 87th Regiment
seized eight guns which were in action, and captured
thirty baggage waggons with their teams, as well as
hundreds of cavalry horses wandering riderless. The
cavalry of the advanced guard of the Vth Corps also
made prisoners of General Brahaut and his staff, besides
a great number of dispersed infantrymen and 150
draught-horses, together with forty ammunition and
baggage waggons.</p>

<p>In the direction of Floing there was also an attempt
on the part of the French to break through; but the
originally very weak infantry posts at that point had
gradually been strengthened, and the French were
driven from the locality as quickly as they had entered.
And now twenty-six batteries of the Army of the
Meuse<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> crossed their fire with that of the Guard batteries,
in position on the eastern slope of the Givonne
valley. The effect was overwhelming. The French
batteries were shattered and many ammunition waggons
exploded.</p>

<p>General de Wimpffen at first took the advance of
the Germans from the north for nothing more than a
demonstration, but toward midday became completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
convinced that it was a real attack. He therefore
ordered that the two Divisions of the Ist Corps halted in
second line behind the Givonne front, should now return
to the Illy height in support of General Douay. On
rejoining the XIIth Corps he found it in full retreat
on Sedan, and now urgently requested General Douay
to despatch assistance in the direction of Bazeilles.
Maussion's Brigade did actually go thither, followed by
Dumont's Division, which latter was relieved in the
foremost line by Conseil Dumesnil's Division. All this
marching and counter-marching was executed in the
space south of the Bois de Garenne dominated by the
cross fire of the German artillery. The recoil of the
cavalry heightened the confusion, and several battalions
drew back into the insecure protection of the forest.
General Douay, it is true, reinforced by portions of the
Vth Corps, retook the Calvary (of Illy), but was forced
to abandon it by two o'clock; and the forest (of
Garenne) behind it was then shelled by sixty guns of
the Guard artillery.</p>

<p>Liébert's Division alone had up to now maintained
its very strong position on the heights north of Casal.
The amassing at Floing of a sufficient strength from
the German Vth and XIth Corps could only be effected
very gradually. After one o'clock, however, detachments
began to climb the steep hill immediately in its
front, while others went round to the south towards
Gaulier and Casal, and yet others came down from
Fleigneux. The complete intermixture of the troops
prevented any unity of command; and a bloody contest
was carried on for a long time with varying fortunes.
The French Division, attacked on both flanks and also
heavily shelled, at last had its power of resistance
undermined; and the reserves of the VIIth Corps
having already been called off to other parts of the
battle-field, the French cavalry once more devotedly
struck in to maintain the fight.</p>

<p>General Margueritte, with five regiments of light
horse, and two of Lancers, charged to the rescue out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the Bois de Garenne. Almost at the outset he fell
severely wounded, and General Galliffet took his place.
The advance was over very treacherous ground, and
even before the actual charge was delivered the cohesion
of the ranks was broken by the heavy flanking fire
of the Prussian batteries. Still, with thinned ranks but
with unflinching resolution, the individual squadrons
charged on the troops of the 43rd Infantry Brigade, partly
lying in cover, partly standing out on the bare slope
in swarms and groups; and also on the reinforcements
hurrying from Fleigneux. The first line of the former
was pierced at several points, and a band of these
brave troopers dashed from Casal through the intervals
between eight guns blazing into them with case-shot, but
the companies beyond stopped their further progress.
Cuirassiers issuing from Gaulier fell on the hostile
rear, but encountering the Prussian Hussars in the
Meuse valley, galloped off northward. Other detachments
cut their way through the infantry as far as the
narrow pass of St. Albert, where they were met by the
battalions debouching therefrom. Others again entered
Floing only to succumb to the 5th Jägers, who had to
form front back to back. These attacks were repeated
by the French again and again in the shape of detached
fights, and the murderous turmoil lasted for half an hour
with steadily diminishing fortune for the French. The
volleys of the German infantry delivered steadily at a
short range strewed the whole field with dead and
wounded horsemen. Many fell into the quarries or
down the steep declivities, a few may have escaped by
swimming the Meuse; and scarcely more than half of
these brave troops returned to the protection of the forest.</p>

<p>But this magnificent sacrifice and glorious effort of
the French cavalry could not change the fate of the
day. The Prussian infantry had lost but little in the
cut-and-thrust encounters, and at once resumed the
attack against Liébert's Division. But in this onslaught
they sustained heavy losses; for instance, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
three battalions of the 6th Regiment had to be
commanded by lieutenants. But when Casal had been
stormed, the French, after a spirited resistance, withdrew
at about three o'clock to their last refuge in the
Bois de Garenne.</p>

<p>When between one and two o'clock the fighting in
Bazeilles had at first taken a favourable turn, General
de Wimpffen reverted to his original plan of driving
from the village the Bavarians, now exhausted by a
long struggle, and of breaking a way through to
Carignan with the Ist, Vth, and XIIth Corps; while
the VIIth Corps was to cover the rear of this movement.
But the orders issued to that effect in part never
reached the Corps; in part did so so late that circumstances
forbade their being carried out.</p>

<p>In consequence of previously mentioned orders,
besides Bassoigne's Division, the Divisions of Goze
and Grandchamp were still available. Now, at
about three in the afternoon, the two last-named
advanced from Fond de Givonne, over the ridge to the
eastward, and the 23rd Saxon Division, which was
marching up the valley on the left bank of the Givonne,
found itself suddenly attacked by closed battalions accompanied
by batteries. With the support of the left
wing of the Guard Corps and of the artillery fire from
the eastern slope, it soon succeeded in repulsing the
hostile masses, and indeed drove them across the valley
back to Fond de Givonne. The energy of the French
appeared to be by this time exhausted, for they
allowed themselves to be taken prisoners by hundreds.
As soon as a firm footing had been gained on the
heights west of the Givonne, the German artillery
established itself there, and by three o'clock an artillery
line of twenty-one batteries stretching from Bazeilles to
Haybés was in action.</p>

<p>The Bois de Garenne, in which many broken bands
of all Corps and of all arms were straggling in search
of refuge, still remained to be gained. After a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
cannonade the 1st Guard-Division climbed the
heights from Givonne, and were joined by Saxon
battalions, the left wing of the IIIrd army at the
same time coming on from Illy. A wild turmoil
ensued, in which isolated bands offered violent resistance,
while others surrendered by thousands; nor was
it until five o'clock that the Germans had complete
possession of the forest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile long columns of French could be seen
pouring down on Sedan from the surrounding heights.
Disordered bodies of troops huddled closer and closer
in and up to the fortress, and shells from the German
batteries on both sides of the Meuse were constantly
exploding in the midst of the chaos. Pillars of fire were
soon rising from the city, and the Bavarian riflemen,
who had pushed forward through Torcy, were preparing
to climb the palisades at the gate when, at about half-past
four, the white flags were visible on the towers.</p>

<p>The Emperor Napoleon had declined to follow
General de Wimpffen in his attempt to break through
the German lines; he had, on the contrary, ordered
him to enter into negotiations with the enemy. In
consequence of the renewal of the order to that effect
the French suddenly ceased firing.</p>

<p>General Reille now made his appearance in the
presence of the King, who had watched the action
since early morning from the hill south of Frénois.
He was the bearer of an autograph letter from the
Emperor, whose presence in Sedan was till then unknown.
He placed his sword in the hand of the
King, but as this was clearly only an act of personal
surrender, the answer stipulated that an officer should
be commissioned with full powers to treat with General
von Moltke as to the surrender of the French Army.</p>

<p>This painful duty was imposed on General de
Wimpffen, who was in no way responsible for the
desperate straits into which the French army had been
brought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The negotiations were held at Donchery in the night
between the 1st and 2nd September. On the part of
the Germans it had to be insisted on that they durst
not forego the advantages gained over so powerful an
enemy as France. Since the French had regarded
the victory of German arms over other nationalities
in the light of an offence to France, any untimely
generosity might cause them to forget their own defeat.
The only course to pursue was to insist upon the
disarmament and captivity of their entire army,
with the exception that the officers were to be free on
parole.</p>

<p>General de Wimpffen declared it impossible to accept
conditions so hard, the negotiations were broken
off, and the French officers returned to Sedan at one
o'clock on the morning of the 2nd. Before their
departure they were given to understand that unless
the offered terms were accepted by nine o'clock that
morning the artillery would reopen fire.</p>

<p>The capitulation was signed by General de Wimpffen
on the morning of the 2nd, further resistance being
obviously impossible.</p>

<p>Marshal MacMahon was very fortunate in having
been disabled so early in the battle, else on him would
have inevitably devolved the duty of signing the capitulation;
and though he had only carried out the
orders forced upon him by the Paris authorities, he
could hardly have sat in judgment, as he afterwards
did, on the comrade he had failed to relieve.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand why we Germans celebrate
the 2nd of September&mdash;a day on which nothing
memorable happened, but what was the inevitable
result of the previous day's work; the day on which the
army really crowned itself with glory was the 1st of
September.</p>

<p>The splendid victory of that day had cost the Germans
460 officers and 8500 men. The French losses were far
greater; they amounted to 17,000 men, and were chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
wrought because of the full development of the fire
of the German artillery.</p>

<p>The prisoners for the present were assembled on the
peninsula of Iges formed by the Meuse. As supplies
for them were entirely lacking, the Commandant of
Mézières permitted the unrestricted transport of provisions
by the railway as far as Donchery. Two Army
Corps were assigned to the duty of guarding and
escorting the convoys of prisoners, who were sent off in
successive bodies 2000 strong by two roads, one to
Etain, and the other by Clermont to Pont à Mousson,
where the prisoners were taken over by the army
investing Metz, and forwarded to various parts of
Germany.</p>

<h2>PART II.</h2>


<p>While one half of the German Army was thus engaged
in a victorious advance, the other half remained stationary
before Metz.</p>

<p>The foremost line of outposts of the investment
embraced a circuit of more than twenty-eight miles.
An attempt of the concentrated forces of the enemy
to break through would have met at the beginning
of the blockade with but slight opposition. It was
therefore extremely urgent that the several posts
should be strengthened by fortifications. These works,
the clearing of the neighbouring battle-fields, the close
watch kept over every movement of the enemy, the
construction of a telegraph-line connecting the quarters
of the several Staffs, and finally the erection of a sufficiency
of shelter, kept the troops and their leaders
amply occupied. Besides the care of the wounded,
provision had to be made for the sick, whose number
was daily increased by the unusually severe weather
and lack of shelter. The provisioning of the troops
was, however, facilitated by their stationary attitude,
and in addition there now flowed in upon them from
their homes a copious supply of love-gifts.</p>

<p>The first days of the investment went by without
any attempts to break out on the part of the French.
They too were busy reorganizing, collecting ammunition
and supplies.</p>

<p>On the 20th of August Marshal Bazaine had
written to Châlons: "I will give due notice of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
march if, taking everything into consideration, I can
undertake any such attempt." On the 23rd he reported
to the Emperor: "If the news of the extensive reductions
in the besieging army is confirmed, I shall set
out on the march, and that by way of the northern
fortresses, in order to risk nothing."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Sortie from Metz.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(August 26th.)</div>


<p>On the 26th of August, when the Army of Châlons
was still nearly seventy miles distant from the Ardennes
Canal, and its advance on Metz was as yet not generally
known, Marshal Bazaine collected his main forces on
the right bank of the Moselle.</p>

<p>This movement had not escaped the notice of the
German posts of observation, and the field-telegraph
at once disseminated the information.</p>

<p>To support the 3rd Reserve Division at Malroy, ten
battalions of the Xth Corps crossed from the left bank
of the Moselle to Argancy on the right bank. The
25th Division held itself in readiness at the bridge of
Hauconcourt, and the Ist Corps closed up towards
Servigny. In the event of the success of a breach
towards the north, the IIIrd, IVth, and part of the IXth
Corps were available to intercept the enemy's march
about Thionville.</p>

<p>The crossing from the island of Chambière by the
field-bridges which had been built, seriously delayed
the French advance; the IIIrd, IInd, IVth, and VIth
Corps, however, by about noon stood closely concentrated
between Mey and Grimont. Advanced detachments
had already at several points driven in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
German posts south-east of Metz, but instead of now
entering upon a general attack, Marshal Bazaine summoned
all his Corps Commanders to a conference at
Grimont. The Commandant of Metz then made it
known that the artillery ammunition in hand would
suffice for only one battle, that when it was exhausted
the army would find itself defenceless in midst of the
German hosts; the fortress, he continued, was not
defensible in its present state, and could not stand a
siege if the army were to be withdrawn from the place.
All those things might certainly have been seen into
during the stay in Metz; and much more did they
behove to have been known before the army should
cut loose. It was particularly enforced, "That the
preservation of the Army was the best service that could
be rendered to the country, more especially if negotiations
for peace should be entered into." The generals
present all spoke against the prosecution of the proposed
movement; and the Commander-in-Chief, who
had refrained from expressing any opinion in the
matter, gave the order to retire at four o'clock.</p>

<p>The whole affair of the 26th of August can only be
regarded in the light of a parade man&oelig;uvre. Bazaine
reported to the Minister of War that the scarcity of
artillery ammunition made it "impossible" to break
through the hostile lines, unless an offensive operation
from the outside "should force the enemy to raise the
investment." Information as to the "temper of the
people" was earnestly requested.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Bazaine was influenced, not
wholly by military, but also by political considerations;
still it may be asked whether he could have
acted differently in the prevailing confusion of France.
From the correspondence referred to, and his behaviour
in the battles before Metz, his reluctance to quit the
place was evident. Under its walls he could maintain
a considerable army in unimpaired condition till the
given moment. At the head of the only French army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
not yet shattered,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> he might find himself in a position
of greater power than any other man in the country.
This army must, of course, first be freed from the
bonds which now confined it. Even if it should succeed
in forcibly breaking out it would be greatly
weakened; and it was not inconceivable that the
Marshal, as the strongest power in the land, might be
able to offer a price which should induce the enemy to
grant him a passage. Then when at length the time
for making peace should come, the Germans would no
doubt ask: "Who in France is the authority with whom
we can negotiate now that the Empire is overthrown,
and who is strong enough to give a guarantee that the
obligations which he will have undertaken shall be performed?"
That the Marshal, if his plans had come
to fulfilment, would have acted otherwise than in the
interest of France is neither proved nor to be assumed.</p>

<p>But presently a number of men combined in Paris,
who, without consulting the nation, constituted themselves
the Government of the country, and took the
direction of its affairs into their own hands. In opposition
to this party, Marshal Bazaine, with his army at
his back, could well come forward as a rival or a foe;
nay, and&mdash;this was his crime in the eyes of the Paris
Government&mdash;he might restore the authority of the
Emperor to whom he had sworn allegiance. Whether
he might not thus have spared his country longer
misery and greater sacrifices may be left undecided.
But that he was subsequently charged with treason
obviously arose, no doubt, from the national vanity of
the French, which demanded a "Traitor" as a scapegoat
for the national humiliation.</p>

<p>Soon after this demonstration, for it was nothing
more, of the besieged army, the investing forces were,
in fact, reduced by the despatch, on the 29th, in accordance
with orders from the supreme Headquarter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of the IInd and IIIrd Corps to Briey and Conflans, there
to remain. To be sure, from those positions it was in
their power to attack either of the French Marshals, as
might prove requisite; while the XIIIth Corps, newly
formed of the 17th Division, hitherto retained to
defend the coast, and from the Landwehr, was already
within a short distance of Metz.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marshal Bazaine might have realized
that he must abandon his delusion as to a release by
means of negotiations; and he now firmly resolved to
cut his way out by dint of force. The troops were
served out with three days' provisions, and the intendance
was furnished with a supply of "iron rations"
from the magazines of the fortress. That the attempt
should again be made on the right bank of the Moselle
was only to be expected; since by far the larger portion
of the enemy's forces stood entrenched on the left bank.
It would have been very difficult to traverse that hilly
region, intersected by deep ravines; and finally the
army of the Crown Prince on the march to Paris
would have had to be encountered. East of Metz, on
the other hand, there afforded ample space for the
full development of the French forces. By bending of
the south the open country was to be reached, offering
no effective intercepting position to the enemy, whose
line of investment was weakest in that direction. The
march to the north and along the Belgian frontier
entailed more danger and greater obstacles, yet the
Marshal had explicitly indicated this particular road as
that by which he intended to move. The Army of
Châlons was also marching in that direction; its
approach was already reported; and on the 31st of
August, on which day, in fact, Marshal MacMahon's
forces reached Stenay<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> in such disastrous circumstances,
Bazaine's army also issued from Metz.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Noisseville.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(August 31st.)</div>


<p>Of the French Corps then located on the right bank
of the Moselle,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the IIIrd was to cover on the right
flank the advance of the others; one Division was
ordered to move early in a south-easterly direction
with intent to mislead the enemy, its other three
Divisions to take position threatening Noisseville.
Three pontoon bridges were constructed for the crossing
of the rest of the army, and accesses to the heights
in front of St. Julien were prepared. The passage of
the IVth and VIth Corps was to begin at six o'clock,
and they were to take a position which, linking on its
right with the IIIrd Corps, should extend from the
village of Mey by Grimont to the Moselle; the IInd
Corps and the Guard were to follow and form a second
line. With the passage of the artillery reserve and
the cavalry it was expected that the crossing of the
Moselle should be finished by ten o'clock; the trains
were halted on the Isle of Chambière. Thus it was
intended that by noon five Corps should be ready for
the assault of the section of the line of investment from
Retonfay (on the French right) to Argancy (on the left),
a distance of about seven miles, which space had for its
defenders only two German Divisions.</p>

<p>So early as seven o'clock Montaudon's Division issued
from Fort Queuleu, and heading eastward drove the
opposing outposts back on Aubigny. But this demonstration
did not in the least deceive the Germans.
The stir in the French camp had been observed quite
early, and when the mist cleared off and great masses
of French troops were seen in front of Fort St.
Julien, an attempt to break through to the north
was anticipated with certainty, and the necessary dispositions
were immediately undertaken to foil the
effort.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>The 28th Brigade of the VIIth Corps was dispatched
to protect Courcelles, so that thus the 3rd Brigade of
the Ist Corps could be brought nearer to Servigny. The
troops of the Xth Corps which could be spared from
their own section of the line of defence on the left bank
were again set in motion to cross to the right, and the
IXth Corps was held in readiness in anticipation of its
having eventually to follow. The IIIrd Corps and the
Ist Cavalry Division were recalled from Briey and
directed to the plateau of Privat; the IInd was to
stand ready to move off.</p>

<p>The attempt of the French to break out proved on
this day even less successful than on the 26th; the
IVth and VIth Corps crossed each other at the bridges,
and they only reached their rendezvous position at one
o'clock, though it was little more than three miles
further; they then abandoned the intention of an immediate
assault, and set about cooking. A few skirmishes
on the east of Aubigny and on the north towards
Rupigny came to nothing. The Imperial Guard did
not come up till three o'clock, the artillery and cavalry
were still behind.</p>

<p>As entire quiescence now supervened, the Germans
came to the conclusion that the attack must be intended
for the following day. To save the strength of the
troops, part of the reinforcements ordered up had
already been sent back, when, at about four o'clock,
the French suddenly opened a heavy artillery fire.</p>

<p>The Marshal had again summoned his commanders
to assemble at Grimont, this time to inform them of
his dispositions for the attack. It was evident that the
French could not advance towards the north until they
had gained elbow-room by means of an offensive movement
in the eastern direction, and had secured their
right flank. For even if they succeeded in breaking
through the Malroy-Charly line, they could get no
further so long as the Germans were at Servigny and
swept with their fire the plain as far as the Moselle, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
space not more than 5000 paces broad. The Marshal
could not in any case reckon on carrying through his
Artillery Reserve, which did not reach the battle-field
until six o'clock, and the extrication of the baggage
trains which had been left behind on the Isle of
Chambière was clearly impossible. The Cavalry Corps
was still defiling, and could not come up until nine
o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>This unsatisfactory aspect of affairs was in complete
accord with the character of the dispositions of the
French commanders.</p>

<p>Marshal Le B&oelig;uf received orders to advance with
the IInd and IIIrd Corps on both sides of the valley of
St. Barbe, and outflank from the south the 1st Prussian
Division at Servigny, while the IVth Corps assailed it
in front. The VIth Corps had the task of thrusting
forward against the Reserve Division at Charly-Malroy.
Marshal Canrobert was to command the two latter
Corps, and the Guard was to be held back as reserve.</p>

<p>Thus General von Manteuffel had at first to confront
with a small force a greatly superior enemy. This
opposition might be undertaken either in the St. Barbe
position, to outflank which was by no means easy, or on
the line of Servigny&mdash;Poix&mdash;Failly, which, though more
exposed, afforded much greater scope for the use of
artillery. The latter position was chosen on the advice
of General von Bergmann commanding the artillery,
and the Landwehr Brigade was ordered into it from
Antilly, where its place was taken by the 25th Division.
Ten batteries were advanced to a distance of 1000 paces
in front of the line of villages held by the infantry.
Their fire proved so superior to that of the enemy, that
the hostile batteries were soon silenced. The attack on
Rupigny by the French IVth Corps, supported on the
flank though it was by three batteries, remained
stationary for a considerable time, and as the Prussians
had not yet been driven back on St. Barbe, the VIth
French Corps meanwhile could not enter upon any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
serious attack on the Reserve Division at Malroy-Charly.
For the same reason Marshal Canrobert received
the order for the present only to send a
detachment of his force to the attack of the village of
Failly, the northern point of support of the Servigny
position.</p>

<p>Tixier's Division therefore moved out at 7.30 in the
evening from Villers L'Orme, but met with a most
obstinate resistance at Failly. Though attacked on two
sides, pelted by a storm of projectiles, and, as regarded
a part of them, engaged in hand-to-hand fighting, the
East Prussians stoutly held possession of their ground
till the Landwehr Brigade came to their assistance from
Vremy.</p>

<p>Up till now the situation southward of Servigny had
worn a more favourable aspect for the French than
in this northern re-entering angle between two hostile
positions; their IInd and IIIrd Corps in the former
quarter had only the 3rd Brigade of the Ist Prussian
Corps to deal with in front of Retonfay. Montaudon's
and Metman's Divisions moved down by way of Nouilly
into the valley of the Vallières brook; Clinchant's
Brigade stormed the brewery in the face of strong
resistance, and by seven o'clock the defenders of Noisseville
were forced to evacuate the place. Montoy and
Flanville were also taken possession of by the French,
and further south the outposts of the German 4th Brigade
were thrown back through Coincy and Château
Aubigny. The batteries of the 1st Division, after enduring
for a long time the fire of strong swarms of
tirailleurs from the deep hollow south of them, were
forced about seven o'clock to retire in echelon to the
infantry position on the Poix&mdash;Servigny line, fending off
for a time the pursuing enemy with case-shot.</p>

<p>But to this position the Prussians now held on
staunchly, although completely out-flanked on their
left. Potier's Brigade ascended the northern slope of
the Vallières valley, but found it impossible to reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Servigny. A moment later Cissey's Brigade rushed forward
from the west, and seized the graveyard outside
the village. The French IVth Corps struck at the centre
of the Prussian position, but without success. Its effort
to penetrate between Poix and Servigny was frustrated
by the offensive stroke delivered by the battalions of the
2nd Brigade constituting the last reserve&mdash;a counter
attack in which all the troops at hand at once joined.
With drums beating they hurled themselves on the
French, swept them out of the graveyard, and drove
them back down the slope.</p>

<p>In support of the fierce fight here, the 3rd Brigade
about half-past eight marched on Noisseville, whence
it promptly expelled the small detachment found in
possession, but subsequently yielded to superior numbers,
and withdrew to St. Marais.</p>

<p>The din of strife had now fallen silent at all points,
and the fight seemed to be ended. The infantry of the
1st Division were moving into the villages, and the
artillery was going into bivouac, when suddenly at nine
o'clock a great mass of French infantry advanced in the
darkness to an attack on Servigny. This proved to be
Aymard's Division; it entered the village without
firing a shot, surprised the garrison, and drove it out
after a fierce hand-to-hand fight. This episode remained
unnoticed for a long time, even by the nearest
troops; but these then rushed to arms, and pouring in
from all sides, drove the French back beyond the
graveyard, which thenceforth remained in German
possession.</p>

<p>It was now ten o'clock at night. The 1st Division
had kept its ground against an enemy of superior
strength; but the French had penetrated into the unoccupied
gap between the 3rd and 4th Brigades, and
were a standing menace to the German flank at Servigny
from their position at Noisseville.</p>

<p><i>September 1st.</i>&mdash;The 18th Division, by a night-march,
crossed from the left to the right bank of the Moselle at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
four o'clock in the morning, and reinforced with a
brigade both flanks of the line Malroy&mdash;Charly&mdash;Bois
de Failly. The 25th Division was now able to fall back
from Antilly to St. Barbe, where, with the 6th Landwehr
Brigade, it formed a reserve for the Poix&mdash;Servigny
position.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 1st of September a thick mist
still shrouded the plain when all the troops stood to
arms.</p>

<p>Marshal Bazaine now again indicated to his generals
the seizure of St. Barbe as the prime objective, since
that alone could render possible the march to the
north; and he added, "In the event of failure, we shall
maintain our positions." This expression could only
indicate the intention, in the event specified, of remaining
under shelter of the cannon of Metz, and evinced
but little confidence in the success of the enterprise
now engaged in.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>So early as five o'clock the 3rd Brigade had deployed
on the Saarlouis road to prevent the further progress
of the enemy on the left flank of the 1st Division. It
swept the slopes in the direction of Montoy with the
fire of twenty guns, and when Noisseville had been
well plied for a considerable time by the fire of the
artillery of the 2nd Brigade, about seven o'clock the
43rd Regiment carried the village by storm. A fierce
fight ensued in and about the houses: two French
brigades struck into the combat, and after a long whirl
of fighting the German regiment was driven out again.
Battalions of the 3rd Brigade came up just as the fight
was over, but the attack was not renewed.</p>

<p>Now that the direction of the French effort to break
out was no longer doubtful, the 28th Brigade had
started from Courcelles at six in the morning to reinforce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the Ist Corps. Its two batteries silenced those of
the French at Montoy, and then directed their fire on
Flanville. The enemy soon began to abandon the
burning village, which, at nine o'clock, the Rhinelanders
entered from the south and the East Prussians
from the north. Marshal Le B&oelig;uf again sent forward
Bastoul's Division on Montoy, but the extremely
effective fire of the Prussian artillery compelled it to
turn back.</p>

<p>The 3rd Brigade had meanwhile taken up a position
on the upland of Retonfay, where it was now joined by
the 28th. The 3rd Cavalry Division was reinforced by
the Hessian Horse Brigade, and these troops with the
artillery mass made up presently to 114 guns, formed
a rampart against any further progress of the IInd and
IIIrd French Corps.</p>

<p>The fighting had now died out on the right wing
of the French army; but the IVth Corps had been
enjoined to await the direct advance of the troops of that
wing before renewing its attack on the artillery-front
and village entrenchments of the line from Servigny to
Poix, whose strength had been proved on the previous
day. But towards eleven o'clock, after Noisseville
had been heavily bombarded, the 3rd Prussian Brigade,
supported by the Landwehr, advanced southward of the
position, pushed its attack against that point, and
compelled the French to withdraw from the burning
village.</p>

<p>Marshal Canrobert, on the northern front of the
sortie, had brought up his batteries at Chieulles by
half-past eight, and their fire, seconded by that of the
artillery of the fortress, caused a temporary evacuation
of Rupigny; but the village was soon reoccupied.
Tixier's Division had made two fruitless attempts to
seize Failly, and now, on the other hand, the 36th
Brigade of the 18th Division came up, and taking the
offensive in conjunction with the Reserve Division, at
ten o'clock drove the French back over the Chieulles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
stream. They made still another onslaught on Failly,
but the flanking fire made this also a failure.</p>

<p>Marshal Le B&oelig;uf, though he still had more than
two Divisions to oppose it, held himself obliged to
retreat on account of the approach of the Prussian 3rd
Brigade on his right flank; and in consequence of the
receipt of this intelligence, Marshal Bazaine at mid-day
ordered the fighting to be broken off at all other points.</p>

<p>The Army of the Rhine which issued from Metz on
August 31st, with a strength of 137,000 men,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> had
been successfully opposed by no more than 36,000
Prussians. In this battle for the first time in the war
the French were the assailants, the Germans had the
rôle of the defence. That the Germans lost 3400 men
against the loss of 3000 by the French, must be attributed
to the higher properties of the infantry weapon
of the latter. But the superiority of the Prussian
artillery was decisively proved, and this it was which
rendered possible General von Manteuffel's unshaken
resistance.</p>

<p>The VIIth Corps remained on the right bank of the
Norelle, where the line of investment was now further
strengthened by the arrival of the XIIIth Corps under
the command of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg. On
the left bank the IInd and IIIrd Corps were now able
to return to their respective previous positions. On
the same day and at about the same hour when the destruction
of one French army was completed at Sedan,
the other was returning to an apparently more and more
hopeless detention in Metz. Thus the issue of the war
was already beyond doubt after a campaign of but two
months' duration; though the war itself was far from
being ended.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Change of Government in Paris.</span></h2>


<p>When, in the night of the 4th of September, the
news of the disaster of Sedan and the Emperor's
surrender became known in Paris, the Legislative Body
met in a rapidly successive series of sittings for the purpose
of selecting an Administrative Committee. The
mob cut those deliberations short by forcing its way
into the Chamber and proclaiming the Republic there
and at the Hôtel de Ville, amidst the acclamations of
the people. Though the troops were under arms in
their barracks, the Government till now in power
offered no resistance; the Empress left Paris; General
Trochu and several members of the Minority in the
Chamber combined to form a Government, which they
styled "The Government of National Defence and
War." "War to the bitter end" was its motto, and
the entire nation was to be called to arms. Not an inch
of territory, not a stone of the fortresses was to be
yielded up to the enemy.</p>

<p>Such a Government, devoid of any legitimate foundation,
necessarily thirsted for results, and could be little
disposed to allow the war to end in peace.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the early reverses of the war,
France was too rich in resources to find herself as yet
by any means defenceless. General Vinoy was still in
the field. All the scattered Corps, the Marine troops
and the Gendarmerie could gather to him. There was,
too, the "Territorial Militia," numbering 468,000 men,
an institution which the country owed to Marshal Niel,
whose far-seeing work of reorganization had been cut
short only too soon. Further, there was available
to be called up the falling-due contingent of 100,000
conscripts, as well as the National Guard. It followed
that France was thus able to put into the field
a million of men, without reckoning Franctireurs and
Volunteer Corps. The reserve store of 2000 guns and
400,000 Chassepôts assured the means of armament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and the workshops of neutral England were ready and
willing to fulfil commissions. Such resources for war,
backed by the active patriotism of the nation, could
maintain a prolonged resistance if a master will
should inspire it with energy.</p>

<p>And such a will was disclosed in the person of
Gambetta.</p>

<p>Minister of War, he had at the same time, by the
French system of government, the direction of military
operations, and certainly he was not the man to loosen
his grasp of the chief command. For in a Republic, a
victorious general at the head of the Army would at once
have become Dictator in his stead. M. de Freycinet,
another civilian, served under Gambetta as a sort of
Chief of the General Staff, and the energetic, but dilettante,
commandership exercised by these gentlemen cost
France very dear. Gambetta's rare energy and unrelenting
determination availed, indeed, to induce the
entire population to take up arms, but not to direct
these hasty levies with comprehensive unity of purpose.
Without giving them time to be trained into fitness for
the field, with ruthless severity he despatched them
into the field in utter inefficiency as they were called
out, to attempt the execution of ill-digested plans
against an enemy on whose firm solidity all their
courage and devotion was inevitably wrecked. He
prolonged the struggle at the cost of heavy sacrifices
on both sides, without turning the balance in favour of
France.</p>

<p>In any event the German chiefs had still great difficulties
to overcome.</p>

<p>The battles already won had cost heavy losses; in
officers especially the losses were irreparable. Half the
army was detained before Metz and Strasburg. The
transport and guarding of already more than 200,000
prisoners required the services of a large part of the
new levies being formed at home. The numerous
fortresses had not indeed hindered the invasion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
German army, but they had to be invested or kept
under observation to secure the rearward communications,
and to safeguard the forwarding and victualling
of troops; and each further advance into the enemy's
country involved increased drafts of armed men. After
the battle of Sedan only 150,000 men were available for
further operations in the field. There could be no
doubt that the new objective must be Paris, as the seat
of the new Government and the centre of gravity, so to
speak, of the whole country. On the very day of the
capitulation of Sedan, all the dispositions were made
for the renewal of the advance.</p>

<p>To spare the troops, the movement was to be carried
out on a very broad front, which involved no risk, for
of the French Corps, the XIIIth alone could possibly
cause any detention. And, indeed, only Blanchard's
Division of that Corps was now at Mézières; its other
two Divisions had but just begun their march when they
received orders to halt preparatory to returning (to
Paris).</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Retreat of General Vinoy.</span></h2>


<p>General Vinoy's most urgent anxiety was&mdash;very
rightly&mdash;to reach Paris with the least possible loss.
This was not very easy to accomplish, since the VIth
Prussian Corps, which had taken no part in the battle
of Sedan, was at Attigny in such a position that as a
matter of distance, as far as to Laon, it could reach any
point of any line of the enemy's retreat before, or as
soon as the latter. General von Tümpling, commanding
that Corps, had already taken possession of Rethel
with the 12th Division by the evening of September
1st, thus closing the high-road to Paris. Only extraordinary
forced marching and a succession of fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
circumstances could save from destruction Blanchard's
Division, which had already wasted its ammunition in
small conflicts.</p>

<p>General Vinoy supplied the troops with several days'
rations, enjoined the strictest discipline on the march,
and during the night between 1st and 2nd September
set out on the road to Rethel, where he expected to
find Exéa's Division; which, however, availing itself of
the section of railway still undestroyed, had already
gone back to Soissons.</p>

<p>It was still early morning (of 2nd) when the French
column of march came in contact with the 5th and
presently with the 6th Prussian Cavalry Divisions,
without, however, being seriously attacked. It was not
till about ten o'clock, and within about seven miles of
Rethel, that the French general learnt that place was
in hostile possession, whereupon he decided on turning
westward to Novion Porcien. He sent his rear-guard
against the enemy's horse-artillery, but seeing hardly
anything but cavalry in its front, it soon resumed the
march. At about four in the afternoon the Division
reached Novion, where it went into bivouac.</p>

<p>General von Hoffmann (commanding the 12th
Prussian Division) had taken up a position at Rethel,
and was awaiting the enemy, of whose approach he
had been warned. Having ridden out in person, he
became aware of Vinoy's deviation from the Rethel road,
and at four in the afternoon marched to Ecly, where
he arrived late in the evening. Part of his troops
scouted forward toward Château Porcien.</p>

<p>General Vinoy, on learning that this road, too, was
closed to him, quited his bivouac again at half-past one
on the morning (of 3rd), leaving his fires burning, and
set out on a second night-march in pouring rain and
total darkness.</p>

<p>At first he took a northerly direction, to reach Laon
at worst by the byways. By tracks fathomless in mud,
and with frequent alarms, but without being reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
by the enemy, he trudged into Château Porcien at
half-past seven on the morning of the 3rd, and there
halted for a couple of hours. The trend of the roads
now compelled him again to take a southerly direction,
and when the head of his column reached Séraincourt,
the sound of firing told him that his rear had been
attacked by the Germans.</p>

<p>The Prussian cavalry had, early the same morning,
discovered the French departure, but this important
information found General von Hoffmann no longer in
Ecly. He had already started thence to search for the
enemy at Novion-Porcien, where he might well be
expected to be after his first night-march, but at half-past
nine the Prussian general found the place empty.
Thus, that morning, the German and French Divisions
had marched past each other in different directions at
a distance apart of little more than four miles. The
thick weather had prevented them seeing each other.
General Vinoy this day reached Montcornet, in what
plight may be imagined. The 12th Division continued
its pursuit in the westerly direction, but came up
only with the rear stragglers of the fast-retreating
enemy, and took up alarm-quarters in Chaumont
Porcien.</p>

<p>This march of the enemy ought not indeed to have
remained unobserved and unchecked under the eye of
two Cavalry Divisions, but it has to be said that these
were called off at an unfortunate moment.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, in consequence of a report that the
French forces were assembled at Rheims, that the
Headquarter of the IIIrd Army had ordered the
immediate return of the VIth Corps and the two Divisions
of cavalry. These at once relinquished the
pursuit, and General von Tümpling ordered his two
Infantry Divisions to march at once on Rheims. The
11th, which had been holding Rethel, set out forthwith.
General von Hoffmann, on the contrary, followed up the
French, on his own responsibility, as far as was possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
without cavalry to overtake them. Not till the following
day did the 12th Division reach the Suippe.</p>

<p><i>September 4th.</i>&mdash;General Vinoy made his way northward
again, by way of Marle, where he received the news
of the Emperor's surrender and of the outbreak of the
revolution in Paris. His presence there was now of
the greatest importance, and on the 13th he reached
the French capital with the two other divisions of his
Corps from Laon and Soissons.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE MARCH ON PARIS<br />
<span class="smcap">of the IIIrd Army and the Army of the Meuse.</span></h2>


<p>During these occurrences the German armies, on the
4th September, had begun their advance on Paris.
The first thing to be done was to disentangle the mass
of troops assembled in the cramped space around Sedan.
The IIIrd Army, of which the XIth and the Ist
Bavarian Corps were still remaining there, had to
make two long marches forward in order that the
Army of the Meuse should regain its line of supply
(Etappen-line).</p>

<p>The news of a great assemblage of French troops at
Rheims soon proved to be unfounded. Early on the
4th, detachments of Prussian horse entered the hostile
and excited city, the 11th Division arrived that afternoon,
and on the following day the German King's
head-quarters were established in the old city where
the French Kings had been wont to be crowned.</p>

<p>On the 10th of September the IIIrd Army had
reached the line Dormans&mdash;Sezanne, and the VIth Corps
had pushed forward to Château Thierry. The Army
of the Meuse, after the failure of a coup-de-main on
Montmédy, was advancing between Rheims and Laon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Cavalry sent far in advance covered this march executed
on a front so exceptionally broad. The scouts everywhere
found the inhabitants in a very hostile temper;
the franctireurs attacked with great recklessness, and
had to be driven out of several villages by dismounted
troopers. The roads were in many places wrecked by
the tearing up of the stone pavement, and the bridges
were blown up.</p>

<p>On the approach of the 6th Cavalry Division Laon
had capitulated. Small detachments of troops of the
line were taken prisoners, 25 guns, 100 stores of arms
and ammunition were seized as prizes, and 2000
Gardes-Mobiles were dismissed to their homes on
parole to take no further part in the war. While
friends and foes were assembled in large numbers in
the courtyard of the citadel, the powder-magazine
blew up, having probably been intentionally fired, and
did great damage both there and in the town. The
Prussians had fifteen officers and ninety-nine men killed
and wounded; among the wounded were the Division-Commander
and his general-staff officer. The French
lost 300 men; the commandant of the fortress was
mortally wounded.</p>

<p>On the 16th the Army of the Meuse was between
Nanteuil and Lizy-on-Ourcq; the 5th Cavalry Division
had advanced to Dammartin; the 6th to beyond Beaumont,
sending patrols up to before St. Denis. The
IIIrd Army was spread over the area from Meaux to
Compte Robert. Strong military bridges had been
thrown over the Marne at Trilport and Lagny to
replace the permanent ones which had been blown up,
and on the 17th the Vth Corps reached the Upper
Seine.</p>

<p>To secure the draw-bridges at Villeneuve St. Georges,
the 17th Brigade pushed on down the right bank of the
Seine towards Paris, and at Mont Mesly it encountered
Exéa's Division, which had been sent out by General
Vinoy to bring in or destroy stores of supplies. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fight which ensued ended in the French being driven
back under shelter of Fort Charenton.</p>

<p>The IInd Bavarian Corps also reached the Seine on
this day and bridged the river at Corbeil. The 2nd
Cavalry Division was in observation in front of Saclay,
towards Paris. The Royal head-quarter moved to
Meaux by way of Château Thierry. The complete
investment of the French capital was now imminent.</p>

<p>The works constructed under Louis Philippe effectually
protected the city from being taken by storm.
The artillery armament of the place consisted of over
2627 pieces, including 200 of the largest calibres of naval
ordnance. There were 500 rounds for each gun, and
in addition a reserve of three million kilogrammes of
powder. As concerned the active strength of the
garrison, besides the XIIIth Corps which had returned
from Mézières, a new Corps, the XIVth, had been
raised in Paris itself. These 50,000 troops of the line,
14,000 highly efficient and staunch marines and sailors,
and about 8000 gensd'armes, customs officers, and
forest-guards, formed the core of the defence. There
were besides 115,000 Gardes-Mobiles, who had been
drawn in from outside at an earlier date. The National
Guard was formed into 130 battalions, which, however,
being defective in equipment and poorly disciplined,
could be employed only in the defence of the inner
circle of fortifications. The volunteers, though
numerous, proved for the most part useless.</p>

<p>In all the besieged force was over 300,000 strong,
thus it was far more than double the strength of the
besiegers as yet on the spot, of whom there were at
the outside only about 60,000 men available, with 5000
cavalry and 124 field-batteries. On the Seine the
defence had five floating batteries and nine section-built
gunboats originally intended for the Rhine; on the
railways were some guns mounted on armour-plated
trucks.</p>

<p>Great difficulties necessarily attended the victualling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of two million human beings for a long period; however,
the authorities had succeeded in gathering into
Paris 3000 oxen, 6000 swine, and 180,000 sheep, with
considerable stores of other provisions, so that perfect
confidence was justifiable, that Paris could hold out for
six weeks at least.</p>

<p>Orders issued from the head-quarter at Meaux
charged the Army of the Meuse with the investment
of the capital on the right bank of the Seine and
Marne,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and the IIIrd Army with the section on the
left bank of both rivers. As a general rule the troops
were to remain beyond range of the fire of the fortress,
but, short of that, were to keep as close as possible so
as to curtail the circuit of environment. The close
connection of the two armies was to be secured above
Paris by several bridges across both the rivers, and
below the city, by the cavalry occupying Poissy. To
the IIIrd Army was to belong the duty of reconnoitring
in the direction of Orleans. In case of any
attempt to relieve the capital it was to allow the
relieving force to approach within a short distance, and
then, leaving the investment to be maintained by
weak details, to strike the enemy with its main body.</p>

<p>Without relief from outside, a close passive blockade
must inevitably result in the capitulation of Paris,
though probably not for some weeks or even months.
As an ultimate compulsory measure there remained
recourse to a bombardment.</p>

<p>At the time when Paris was fortified it was not
foreseen that improvements in the artillery arm would
double or treble the range of fire. The exterior forts,
especially on the south, were at so short a distance
from the enceinte that the city could easily be reached
by the fire of heavy batteries.</p>

<p>The Germans have been blamed for not having had
recourse at an earlier date to this expedient of bombardment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
but this criticism indicates an inadequate
appreciation of the difficulties which stood in the way
of its earlier execution.</p>

<p>It may safely be accepted that the attack of a large
fortified place in the heart of an enemy's country is
simply impossible so long as the invader is not master
of the railways or waterways leading to it, by which
may be brought up in full quantity the requisite
material. The conveyance of this by the ordinary
highways, even for a short distance, is in itself a
herculean undertaking. Up to this time the German
army had the control of only one railway in French
territory, and this was fully occupied in the maintenance
of supplies for the armies in the field: in bringing
up reinforcements and equipment; in conveying
rearward wounded, sick and prisoners. But even this
much of railway service ended at Toul; and the
attempt to turn that fortress by laying a temporary
section of line found insurmountable difficulties in the
nature of the ground. Further forward there interposed
itself a scarcely inferior obstacle in the complete
destruction of the Nanteuil tunnel, to repair which
would probably require weeks.</p>

<p>Even then, for the further transport from Nanteuil
up to the Paris front of 300 heavy guns with 500
rounds for each gun, there were requisite 4500 four-wheeled
waggons, such as were not in use in the
country, and 10,000 horses. Thus a bombardment was,
in the earlier period, not to be thought of, and in any
case the object of it would not be to destroy Paris, but
merely to exert a final pressure on the inhabitants; and
this influence would be more effectual when a long
blockade had shaken the resolution of the besieged than
it was likely to be at the beginning of the investment.</p>

<p><i>September 18th.</i>&mdash;Corresponding directions communicated
to the respective army commands, ordered
the resumption of the march on the enemy's capital.</p>

<p>On the 18th the Army of the Meuse, swinging leftward,
had the XIIth Corps at Claye, the Guard Corps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
at Mitry, and the IVth Corps at Dammartin, one march
from Paris.</p>

<p>All the villages in front of St. Denis were occupied
by the French. It seemed as if the investment on the
north front of Paris would be resisted, and the Crown
Prince of Saxony took measures for next day to follow
up and support the IVth Corps, which led the advance.
The 5th and 6th Cavalry Divisions, hastening on to
Pontoise, were given two companies of Jägers and a
pontoon train, and after a bridge had been laid they
crossed the Oise.</p>

<p>The Vth Corps of the IIIrd Army passed over the
Seine at Villeneuve-St.-Georges and advanced to
Palaiseau and the Upper Bièvre. The advanced guard
came into collision with Bernis' French Cavalry Brigade.
The 47th Regiment at once proceeded to the attack,
and stormed the walled farmsteads of Dame Rose and
Trivaux. But on the southern skirt of the forest of
Meudon the whole of the French XIVth Corps was
drawn up; on its left stood a Division of the XIIIth
Corps. The regiment retired on Petit Bicêtre without
being followed, and there took up a defensive position.</p>

<p>The IInd Bavarian Corps marched from Corbeil by
Longjumeau on a parallel front with the Vth Corps,
and on the right the VIth occupied both banks of the
Seine. These Corps, too, had several brushes with the
enemy.</p>

<p>The Würtemberg Division at Lagny and Gournay
was to cross the Marne forthwith, and so establish
communication between the two armies.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Investment of Paris.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(September 19th.)</div>


<p>On the 19th September the IVth Corps met with
no opposition in its advance to St. Brice; it drove detachments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of the enemy from the neighbouring villages
back under cover of the heavy guns of St. Denis, and
pushed forward towards the Lower Seine. The Guard
Corps followed it as far as Dugny, and lined the
Morée brook, which was dammed up at its mouth, and
afforded useful cover for the line of investment along
a considerable distance. Further to the left the XIIth
Corps took up a position extending to the Marne, and
on the left bank of that river the Würtemberg Division
advanced to Champigny.</p>

<p>On this day the Vth Corps of the IIIrd Army
marched on Versailles in two columns. The 47th
Regiment had again the duty of covering the march
along the hostile front. The French evidently were
anxious to remain masters of the important heights in
front of the fortifications of Paris, and in the early
morning two divisions of their XIVth Corps marched
out of the neighbouring forest of Meudon against Petit
Bicêtre and Villacoublay. Supported by a numerous
artillery, which set on fire the farm-buildings of Petit
Bicêtre, they drove back the German outposts; but
reinforcements from the Vth Corps presently came
up to Villacoublay, and to Abbaye aux Bois from the
IInd Bavarian Corps.</p>

<p>The left brigade of the latter had crossed the
columns marching on Versailles in the valley of the
Bièvre; but the sound of fighting from the field of
strife induced General von Dietl<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> to advance with his
detachments as they came up singly, on both sides of
the high-road to Bicêtre. A conjunct assault with the
Prussians still fighting in the Bois de Garenne, was
successful in repulsing the French at Pavé blanc.
Meanwhile the enemy by half-past eight had formed an
artillery front of fifty guns, and three regiments of
march advanced to renew the attack on Petit Bicêtre
and the Bois de Garenne. They were received with
a destructive musketry fire, and not even General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Ducrot's personal influence could persuade the troops,
who were young recruits, to go forward. The Zouaves
posted about the farm of Trivaux were finally thrown
into such confusion by some shells falling among them
that they hurried back to Paris in headlong flight.</p>

<p>General Ducrot had to abandon his attempt. His
Divisions retired in evident disorder on Clamart and
Fontenay, under cover of the artillery and of the
cavalry, which had resolutely endured the hostile fire;
pursued at their heels by the German troops. The
Bavarians stormed Pavé blanc under a heavy cannon
fire; the Prussians retook Dame Rose after a trivial
skirmish, and pushed on past the farm of Trivaux into
the forest of Meudon. The French still held the
heights of Plessis-Piquet, which were to them of vast
importance and very easy of defence, as well as the
redoubt at Moulin de la Tour, where nine field-batteries
at once came into action, the fire from which commanded
the whole of the western field of operations.</p>

<p>The main body of the Bavarian Corps had meanwhile
moved southward, and during its advance on
Fontenay aux Roses, about nine o'clock, it came under
a hot fire from the height, as well as a flanking fire
from a redoubt near Hautes Bruyères. Being informed
of the situation at the scene of conflict on the
plateau of Bicêtre, General von Hartmann (the Corps
Commander) at once sent thither an artillery reinforcement,
and ordered the 5th Brigade to attempt a junction
to his left by way of Malabry. As soon as this brigade
had deployed under a hot Chassepôt and artillery fire
between Pavé blanc and Malabry, General von Walther
(commanding 3rd Bavarian Division) passed to the
attack of Plessis-Piquet. The artillery advanced to a
short distance on the hither side of the park wall, and
then the infantry broke out from the wood of Verrières,
and, after a brief but sharp struggle, took possession of
the mill lying to the southward. After half an hour's
artillery preparation, the Bavarians advanced on Hachette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
by rushes, and broke into the park of Plessis. The
French kept up a hot fire from the redoubt of Moulin
de la Tour on the localities wrenched from them, by
which the Bavarian field batteries suffered severely;
but they still effectively supported the further advance
of the infantry, who now got close in under the earthworks.
However, the defenders were already on the
point of retiring, and when about three o'clock one
Bavarian company entered, it found the place deserted
and the guns left in position.</p>

<p>Caussade's Division had left Clamart and was on the
way to Paris; Maussion's had abandoned the heights of
Bagneux on the pretence of having received mistaken
orders, and Hughes' Division was with difficulty brought
to a halt under cover of Fort Montrouge.</p>

<p>The Bavarian Corps now took up the position it had
won on the plateau of Bicêtre to the right of the Vth
Corps. The fight had cost the former 265 men and the
latter 178; the French lost 661 killed and above 300
prisoners.</p>

<p>The condition in which the French XIVth Corps
returned to Paris caused such dismay that General
Trochu found himself obliged to withdraw a Division
of the XIIIth from Vincennes for the defence of the
enceinte.</p>

<p>It was subsequently argued that it would have
been possible to capture one of the forts on this
day by forcing an entrance along with the fugitive
enemy, with the result of materially shortening
the siege. But the forts did not need to open their
gates to shelter fugitives, to whom those of the
capital stood open. The escalade of masonry escarpments
eighteen feet high can never be successful
without much preparation. Ventures of this character
are rarely ordered by superior authority; but can be
attempted only in a propitious moment by those on the
spot. In this case probable failure would have endangered
the important success of the day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The Vth Corps had meanwhile proceeded on its march
to Versailles; a few National Guards, who had collected
at the entrance to the town, were driven off or disarmed
by the German Hussars. The 9th Division
held the eastern exits of the town, the 10th encamped
at Rocquencourt, and strong outposts were
pushed out on the Bougival&mdash;Sèvres line. The 18th
Brigade, which remained at Villacoubay to support the
Bavarians in case of need, did not reach Versailles
until the evening.</p>

<p>The 3rd Bavarian Division remained on the heights
in front of Plessis Piquet, its outposts confronting the
forest of Meudon, where the French were still in possession
of the château; and the pioneers at once altered
the redoubt of La Tour du Moulin so as to front north.
The 12th Division was encamped at Fontenay and
rearward as far as Châtenay.</p>

<p>The main body of the VIth Corps had taken position
at Orly, its outposts extending from Choisy le Roi past
Thiais to Chevilly. Maud'huy's Division attempted to
drive in the outpost line at the last-named village, but
without success. A brigade of the same Corps at
Limeil, on the right bank of the Seine, was engaged in
skirmishing with the French at Créteil. Within touch,
further to the right, the Würtemberg Division held the
(left) bank of the Marne from Ormesson to Noisy le
Grand, behind which latter place the pontoon bridge
near Gournay assured communication with the Saxon
Corps.</p>

<p>Thus on the 19th of September the investment of
Paris was complete on all sides. Six Army Corps
stood in a deployment some fifty miles in circumference
immediately in front of the enemy's capital,
in some places actually within range of his guns, its
rear guarded by a large force of cavalry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="smcap">First Negotiations for Peace.</span></h2>


<p>In full expectation of a battle to the north of Paris,
the King had ridden out to join the Guard Corps, and
in the evening his head-quarters were moved to
Ferrières.</p>

<p>Here thus early Monsieur Jules Favre made his
appearance to negotiate for peace on the basis of "not
one foot of soil." He believed that after all their
victories and losses, the Germans would come to terms
on payment of a sum of money. It was self-evident
that such a proposal could not be taken into consideration,
and only the eventuality of granting an armistice
was seriously discussed.</p>

<p>It was in the political interest of Germany as well,
to afford the French nation the possibility of establishing
by its own free and regular election a government
which should have full right to conclude a peace
creditable to the people; for the self-constituted de
facto Government ruling in Paris was the offspring of
a revolution, and might at any moment be removed by
a counter-revolution.</p>

<p>From a military point of view it was true that any
pause in the active operations was a disadvantage. It
would afford the enemy time to push forward his preparations,
and by raising for a time the investment of
Paris would give the capital the opportunity to reprovision
itself at discretion.</p>

<p>The armistice could, therefore, only be granted in
consideration of a corresponding equivalent.</p>

<p>To secure the subsistence of the respective German
armies, Strasburg and Toul, which now intercepted the
railway communication, must be given over. The
siege of Metz was to be maintained; but with regard to
Paris, either the blockade was to continue; or, if it were
raised, one of the forts commanding the capital was to
be occupied by the Germans. The Chamber of Deputies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
was to be allowed to meet at Tours in full
freedom.</p>

<p>These conditions, especially the surrender of the
fortified places, were absolutely rejected on the French
side, and the negotiations were broken off. Eight days
later Toul and Strasburg were in the hands of the
Germans.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Reduction of Toul.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(September 23rd.)</div>


<p>As soon as the German coast seemed no longer
threatened by the danger of a landing of French troops,
the 17th Division, which had been left behind there,
was ordered to join the army in France. It arrived
before Toul on September 12th.</p>

<p>This place, in itself exempt from capture by storm
but commanded by neighbouring heights, had till now
been invested by Etappen troops of the IIIrd Army,
and shelled by the guns taken at Marsal and with field-guns,
but without any particular effect. The infantry
on the other hand had established a footing behind
the railway embankment and in the suburbs close up to
the foot of the glacis, so that sorties by the garrison were
rendered almost impossible. In view of these circumstances
half the Division was presently sent to Châlons,
where sixteen battalions and fifteen squadrons barely
sufficed to deal with the extremely hostile attitude of
the people, hold the Etappen-lines and safeguard the
communication with Germany. Thus only seven
battalions, four squadrons, and four field-batteries remained
before Toul.</p>

<p>On the 18th there arrived from Nancy by railway
ten 15 cm. and sixteen 12 cm. siege guns. The intention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was to attack the western face, which was
enfiladed from Mont St. Michel, and then to breach the
south-west bastion; but first an (unsuccessful) attempt
was made to reduce the place by the shorter process of
subjecting it to a bombardment with field artillery.</p>

<p>On the night of the 22nd battery-emplacements for
the siege artillery were constructed by the infantry;
three on Mont St. Michel, seven on the heights on the
left bank of the Moselle, and one on the right bank.
Next morning sixty-two guns opened fire, and at half-past
three in the afternoon the white flag was hoisted
on the Cathedral.</p>

<p>The handing over of the place followed the same
day (23rd), on the conditions as had been granted
at Sedan. A hundred and nine officers were released
on parole, 2240 rank and file were taken prisoners.
Six companies took possession the same evening of the
city, which on the whole had suffered little.</p>

<p>Twenty-one heavy guns, about 3000 stand of arms,
and large stores of provisions and forage were the prizes
of success.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Reduction of Strasburg.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(September 28th.)</div>


<p>Immediately after the victory of Wörth, the reduction
of Strasburg became a primary object. This
strong fortified position, bridge-head as it was commanding
the Rhine, was a standing menace to Southern
Germany.</p>

<p>When Marshal MacMahon evacuated Alsace, only
three battalions of the line were left with the commandant
of Strasburg. But with stragglers from the
various regiments engaged at Wörth, with sundry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
fourth battalions and reserve detachments, and finally
with Mobiles and National Guards, the strength of the
garrison had increased to 23,000 men. There was a
complete absence of engineer troops, but 130 marines
formed an excellent nucleus; the armament of the
fortress was also ample.</p>

<p>So early as on the 11th August the Baden Division had
been detailed to observe Strasburg. Notwithstanding
the smallness of its force the Division had advanced
unchecked by the enemy on the Ruprechtsau as
far as the Rhine-and-Ill Canal; had occupied the
village of Schiltigheim, almost within rifle-shot of the
fortifications: and, having promptly prepared it for
defence, pushed forward into the suburb of Königshofen.</p>

<p>In the course of eight days there arrived, under the
command of General von Werder, the Guard Landwehr
and 1st Reserve Divisions, and one cavalry brigade, in
all 46 battalions, 24 squadrons, and 18 field-batteries;
as well as a siege-train of 200 rifled cannon and 88
mortars, with 6000 foot artillerymen and ten companies
of fortress-pioneers; a total strength of 40,000 men.</p>

<p>The unloading of the guns brought from Magdeburg,
Coblentz, and Wesel was begun on August 18th at the
railway station of Vendenheim, by a detachment of the
Railway Battalion.</p>

<p>The engineer-depôt was established at Hausberge,
a wagon-park at Lampertsheim, and provision made
for permanent magazines. A complete blockade was
established, and the field-telegraph kept up communication
between all the posts.</p>

<p>To attain the desired end with the least possible
delay, an attempt was made, contrary to the advice of
General of Engineers Schultz, though with the sanction
of the supreme Head-quarter, to force the town to
surrender by stress of a bombardment. The request
that the women and children should be allowed to
withdraw was necessarily refused.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The erection of the batteries for the bombardment in
the dark, wet nights was attended with great difficulties.
Meanwhile only the field-guns could fire on the city;
but the batteries whose armament of heavy guns was
complete opened fire on the night of the 24th&mdash;25th;
and soon a great fire was raging. Kehl, on the
right bank of the river, was also set on fire by the
shell-fire.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Strasburg came out to the outposts at
Schiltigheim to entreat forbearance for the citizens.
Much as damage to this German city was to be
regretted, since the Prelate was not empowered to
negotiate the bombardment was continued through
the night of the 25th, when it reached its height.
But the headquarter staff at Mundolsheim became
convinced that this mode of attack would not accomplish
the desired object, and that the more
deliberate course of a regular siege would have to be
resorted to. General von Mertens was placed in charge
of the engineer operations, General Decker was given
the direction of the artillery.</p>

<p>During the night of the 29th&mdash;30th August the first
parallel was opened very close to the glacis, and soon
was prolonged from the Rhine and Marne canal, through
the churchyard of St. Helena, to the Jewish cemetery
at Königshofen.</p>

<p>The number of batteries on the left bank of the
Rhine was soon increased to 21, on the right bank to
4; so that 124 guns of the heaviest calibre were ready
in protected positions to begin the contest with the
guns of the fortress. The further offensive operations
were directed against bastions Nos. 11 and 12 on the
north-west salient of the fortress. In the night of
September 1st&mdash;2nd the second parallel was completed,
but not without opposition. A strong sortie of
fourteen companies of the garrison made at daybreak
(of 2nd) upon the island of Waken, and in front of
Kronenburg and Königshofen, was repulsed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The fortress then opened a heavy fire, pouring such
a storm of projectiles on the siege-works that they had
to be abandoned, till at about nine o'clock the artillery
of the attack had silenced the guns of the fortress. A
second sortie followed on the 3rd September, which
was not repulsed before it had reached the second
parallel.</p>

<p>A short truce was granted at the request of the
commandant, to allow of the burial of the dead lying
in front of the works. And on this day a grand
salvo announced to the besieged the victory of Sedan.</p>

<p>Incessant rain had filled the trenches of the second
parallel, 2400 paces in length, ankle-deep with water,
and it was not till the 9th that they were completely
repaired. Five batteries were moved forward from the
first parallel, as special batteries were required to crush
the fire of lunette No. 44, which took in flank all the
approaches. These soon silenced its guns, and the
lunette was abandoned by the garrison.</p>

<p>There were now 96 rifled cannon pieces and 38
mortars in full fire at very short range. Each gun
was authorized to fire twenty rounds a day and ten
shrapnel each night. The large Finkmatt Barracks
were destroyed by fire, and the Stone Gate was so much
injured that it had to be buttressed with sandbags.
The garrison withdrew the guns behind the parapet,
and only fired their mortars. However, in order to
push forward the siege-works, sap-rollers had to be
brought into use.</p>

<p>When it was discovered that mining galleries were
being driven in front of lunette No. 53, Captain Ledebour
let himself down by a rope into the ditches, and with
the help of his pioneers removed the charges of powder.</p>

<p>During the night of the 13th&mdash;14th, the crest of
the glacis in front of both the lunettes Nos. 52
and 53 was reached. The crowning was then begun
by means of the double traverse sap, and was finished
in four days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The attack henceforth was exclusively directed against
bastion No. 11.</p>

<p>To run off the water from the ditches of the fortress
it was necessary to destroy the sluices by the Jews'
Gate. These were invisible from any part of the field
of attack, and the desired result could only be very
incompletely obtained by artillery fire at a distance of
more than a mile. Detachments of the 34th Fusilier
Regiment, therefore, on the 15th, marched on the
sluices under a heavy rifle fire from the besieged, and
destroyed the dam.</p>

<p>The island of Sporen was at this time taken possession
of by the Baden corps.</p>

<p>When the mortar-batteries had for the most part
been moved up into the second parallel, the gun-batteries
were also advanced nearer, and the wall-piece
detachments did such execution by their accurate
practice that the defenders never more dared to show
themselves by day.</p>

<p>The retaining wall of lunette No. 53 could only be
reached by indirect fire; but 1000 shells made a breach,
and on the 19th September two mines were fired, which
blew up the counterscarp and brought it down to the
level of the water of the ditch. The pioneers immediately
set about laying a dam of fascines across the
ditch. A party sent over in a boat found the work
abandoned. The gorge was closed under heavy rifle fire
from the ramparts of the main fortress, and the parapet
reversed so as to face the place.</p>

<p>The next lunette to the left, No. 52, was merely an
earthwork, and the attack had already been pushed
forward as far as the edge of the ditch, but earth
screens had first to be thrown up and covered in with
railway iron, as a protection against the heavy fire
of shell from bastion No. 12. The construction of a
dam of fascines or earth, more than sixty paces across,
and with the ditch full of water almost fathom deep,
would have taken a long time; so it was decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
make a cask bridge of beer-barrels, of which a quantity
had been found in Schiltigheim. This work was begun
at dusk on the 21st, under no better protection than a
screen of boards to prevent observation, and it was
finished by ten o'clock. Here again the defenders had
not waited for the escalade, and this lunette, too, was
immediately prepared for being held. Both lunettes
were now furnished with batteries of mortars and guns
to silence the fire from the ravelines and counter-guards
of the front of attack, against which five dismounted
and counter-batteries were also directed.</p>

<p>During the night of the 22nd&mdash;23rd the Germans
advanced from lunette No. 52, partly by flying sap and
partly by the deep sap, and there followed the crowning
of the glacis in the front of counter-guard No. 51.
A breaching fire was immediately opened against the
east face of bastion No. 11, and the west face of bastion
No. 12. The splinters of stone compelled the defenders
to abandon the counter-guards. The scarp of bastion
No. 11 fell on the 24th, after a shell-fire of 600 rounds.
The bringing down of the earthwork angle which
remained standing, was postponed till the beginning of
the assault.</p>

<p>It was more difficult to breach bastion No. 12,
because of the limited opportunity for observing the
effect of the fire. It was not till the 26th that a breach
thirty-six feet wide was made, after firing 467 long
shells. And even then, for the actual assault to
succeed, the deep wet ditch at the foot of the bastion
had to be crossed.</p>

<p>News of the fall of the Empire had indeed reached
Strasburg, but General Uhrich would not listen
to the prayers of the citizens that he would put
an end to their sufferings. The Republic was proclaimed.</p>

<p>The siege had lasted thirty days, but the place was
still well supplied with food and stores; the garrison
was not materially weakened by the loss of 2500 men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
but its heterogeneous elements prevented its effective
employment in large bodies outside the walls. From
the first the small blockading force had been allowed to
approach close to the works; and the moment when
the artillery of a fortress always has the advantage
over the attack had been little utilized.</p>

<p>The German artillery had proved much the stronger,
both as regards material and in its advantageous
employment. Under its powerful protection the work
of the pioneers and infantry was carried on with equal
courage and caution, never swerving from the object in
view. The storming of the main walls was now to be
imminently expected, and no relief from outside could
be hoped for.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of September 27th, the white flag
was seen flying from the Cathedral tower; firing ceased
and the sapper-works were stopped.</p>

<p>In Königshofen at two in the following morning the
capitulation was settled, on the Sedan conditions. Five
hundred officers and 17,000 men were made prisoners,
but the former were free to go on their parole. The
National Guards and franctireurs were dismissed to
their homes, after laying down their arms and pledging
themselves to fight no more. All the cash remaining
in the state bank, 1200 guns, 200,000 small arms and
considerable stores proved a valuable prize of war.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock in the morning of the 28th, companies
of Prussian and Baden troops took over the
National, Fischer, and Austerlitz gates. The French
garrison marched out at the National Gate, General
Uhrich at their head. At first the march was conducted
in good order, but before long numbers of
drunken men broke the ranks and refused to obey, or
threw down their arms. The prisoners were taken in
the first instance to Rastatt, under the escort of two
battalions and two squadrons.</p>

<p>The old city of the German Reich, which had been
seized by France in time of peace nearly two centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
earlier, was now restored by German valour to the
German fatherland.</p>

<p>The siege had cost the Germans 39 officers and 894
men. The city unhappily could not have been spared
great suffering. Four hundred and fifty houses were
utterly destroyed, 10,000 inhabitants were roofless,
nearly 2000 were killed or wounded. The museum
and picture gallery, the town hall and theatre, the
new church, the gymnasium, the Commandant's residence,
and alas! the public library of 200,000 volumes
had fallen a prey to the flames.</p>

<p>The noble Cathedral showed many marks of shot,
and the citadel was a heap of ruins. Under the wreck
of the assailed works in the western front lay buried
burst cannon.</p>

<p>The fall of Toul and of Strasburg produced a not
unimportant change in the military situation. Considerable
forces were now free for other services, and
the railway transport could be brought up nearer to
the armies. The material no longer required at
Strasburg could not indeed be at once employed
for the artillery offensive against Paris; it needed
considerable re-equipment, and was to do duty meanwhile
in the reduction of several smaller places.
The newly-opened railway line was made use of to
bring up the Guard Landwehr Division to the army
investing Paris. A new Army Corps, the XIVth, was
created of the Baden Division, a combined brigade
consisting of the 30th and 34th Prussian regiments,
and one cavalry brigade; which, under the command
of General von Werder, marched on the Upper Seine.
The 1st Reserve Division remained behind as the
garrison of Strasburg.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Operations round Paris to 15th October.</span></h2>


<p>The Government in the now closely-blockaded
capital, could not make its behests heard and obeyed
throughout France. It therefore decided on sending a
delegation of two of its members out into the provinces,
their seat of direction to be at Tours. They could quit
Paris only in a balloon. One of these delegates was
Gambetta, whose restless energy soon made itself
conspicuously felt, and lasted during the continuance
of the war. Monsieur Thiers, meanwhile, had been
visiting the European courts on the errand of inducing
them to interpose their good offices in favour
of France.</p>

<p>After the mishap of September 19th the feeling in
Paris was against any great offensive demonstrations for
the present; but the troops of the line still remained
outside the walls under protection of the outlying forts.
The Divisions of the XIIIth Corps were encamped on
the south front and on the plateau of Vincennes; the
XIVth was at Boulogne, Neuilly and Clichy behind
the loops of the Seine, with Mont Valérien in its front,
which was held by two line-battalions, after the flight,
on the 20th, of the Gardes-Mobiles from that impregnable
stronghold, in great disorder back into Paris. The
defence of the northern front of the city remained
entrusted to the Gardes-Mobiles.</p>

<p>On the German side the positions of the Army of
the Meuse, which were to be occupied and defended to
the uttermost, extended from Chatou along the Seine
to the heights of Montmorency, and onward along the
Morée and the skirts of the forest of Bondy as far
as the Marne. In close touch with the flank of the
Army of the Meuse at the Marne, the lines of the
Würtemberg Division carried on the investment from
Noisy le Grand across the Joinville peninsula to
Ormesson. The XIth Corps arriving from Sedan on
the 23rd filled up the interval from Ormesson to Villeneuve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
St. Georges, and the 1st Bavarian Corps occupied
Longjumeau as a protection against attempts from the
direction of Orleans. The VIth Corps could now be
entirely transferred to the left bank of the Seine, where
the line of defence extended along the wooded heights
south of Paris to Bougival.</p>

<p>The Head-quarter of the King and that of the IIIrd
Army were at Versailles, that of the Army of the
Meuse was transferred to Vert-Galant. Numerous
bridges facilitated the inter-communication of the
various portions of the forces, telegraphs and signal-lights
insured their rapid concentration, and every
movement of the French was watched from eligible
posts of observation.</p>

<p>There was no lack of accommodation for the troops, for
every village was deserted; but this made the difficulty
of obtaining supplies all the greater. The fugitive
inhabitants had driven off their cattle and destroyed their
stores; there remained only the apparently inexhaustible
wine-cellars. For the first few days all the food
needed had to be drawn from the Commissariat trains,
but ere long the cavalry succeeded in obtaining considerable
supplies. High prices and good discipline secured
a market. Only the troops in advanced positions had
to bivouac or build huts, many within range of the
hostile artillery, some even within rifle-shot of the
enemy. Near St. Cloud, for instance, no one could show
himself without becoming a mark for the chassepôts
from behind the shutters of the houses opposite. The
outposts here could only be relieved at night, and
sometimes had to remain on duty two or three days at
a time. The advanced positions of the Bavarians at
Moulin la Tour were also much exposed, and the visits
of superior officers to them always drew a sharp
cannonade. Le Bourget, standing as it did in advance
of the line of inundation, was especially liable to a
surprise. That village had been seized on 20th (Sept.)
by a battalion of the Guard Corps, at whose approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
400 Gardes-Mobiles had fled, leaving their baggage.
Only one company occupied this post, on account of
the heavy fire of the adjacent forts.</p>

<p>Some petty sorties from St. Denis met with no
success; but an attempt by detachments of the VIth
Corps to occupy the village of Villejuif and the
redoubt of Hautes Bruyères proved unsuccessful.
They forced their way in several times, but always had
to retire under the fire of the neighbouring forts of
Bicêtre and Ivry, and because of the superior strength
of Maud'huy's Division. The French afterwards armed
the redoubts with heavy guns.</p>

<p><i>September 30th.</i>&mdash;Early on this day a cannonade of
an hour and a half's duration from the southern forts
and batteries announced a sortie in that direction. By
six o'clock two brigades of the XIIIth French Corps
deployed against Thiais and Choisy le Roi. Strong
swarms of tirailleurs drove in the outposts of the VIth
Corps, and forced the field-guns in position between
those two villages to retire; but then the fire of the
infantry garrisons checked any further attack on the
part of the French. Further to the west a third
brigade got into Chevilly and seized a factory on
the road to Belle Epine; but its determined attack
failed to obtain possession of the whole village.
The 11th Division was alarmed in its rearward
quarters, and hurried forward to the support of the
12th. The factory was recovered from the French,
and the Prussian batteries now opened fire, and worked
such havoc among the enemy as he retired on Saussaye,
that, shunning the attack of the infantry, he
fled in great disorder to Hautes Bruyères and Villejuif.
A brigade which had forced its way into L'Hay was in
the same way driven back, leaving 120 prisoners for
the most part unwounded. In the farmstead at the
north entrance of Chevilly, however, the French still
held their ground with great obstinacy. Not till they
were completely surrounded, and had made an ineffectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
attempt to force a passage, did surrender
those brave defenders, who numbered about 100.</p>

<p>The whole series of attacks was entirely defeated by
about nine o'clock, and General Vinoy vainly endeavoured
to incite the diminished battalions at Hautes
Bruyères to renew the struggle.</p>

<p>These few morning hours had cost the VIth Corps
28 officers and 413 men; and the French many more.</p>

<p>Two simultaneous feint-attacks on Sèvres and on
Mesly on the right bank of the Seine, came to nothing.
The German outposts, at first driven in, re-occupied
their ground by about nine o'clock.</p>

<p>After thus failing to gain space towards the southward
by this sortie, the besieged proceeded to assure
themselves of the ground already in their possession
by the construction of entrenchments. They fortified
Villejuif and extended their lines from Hautes Bruyères
past Arcueil to the Mill of Pichon, so that there the
Bavarian outposts had to be drawn in nearer to Bourg-la-Reine.</p>

<p>Otherwise, throughout the first half of the month of
October the garrison of Paris restricted itself for the
most part to daily cannonades. Guns of the heaviest
calibre were directed on the most petty objects. It was
sheer waste of ammunition, just as though the aim was
to get rid of the stores on hand. If one of the gigantic
long shells happened to fall on an outpost, the destruction
was of course terrible; but on the whole they did
little execution.</p>

<p>Apart from the noise of the cannonade to which one
soon became accustomed, in Versailles, whence none of
the residents had fled, it might have been thought a
time of profound peace. The admirable discipline of
the German troops allowed the townsfolk to pursue
their business undisturbed; the hosts were well paid
for the billeting imposed on them, and the country
people could cultivate their fields and gardens in peace.
At St. Cloud every room was kept in the same order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
as when the Imperial family had left it, till the shells
from Mont Valérien reduced that delightful palace with
all its treasures of art to a heap of charred ruins. It
was the French fire, too, which wrecked the Château of
Meudon, the porcelain factory of Sèvres, and whole
villages in the nearer environs. And it was also the
French themselves who, without any necessity, felled
half the Bois de Boulogne.</p>

<p>The investment line was considerably strengthened
on the 10th and 16th of October, when the 17th Division
arriving from Toul relieved the 21st at Bonneuil,
and the latter took up a position between the Bavarians
and the Vth Corps, in the Meudon&mdash;Sèvres tract; and
when the Guard Landwehr Division came up and
occupied St. Germain.</p>

<p>These movements were observed from Paris, and
to clear up the situation, General Vinoy advanced at
nine o'clock on 13th October with about 26,000 men
and 80 guns, against the position held by the IInd
Bavarian Corps.</p>

<p>Four battalions of Gardes-Mobiles, protected by the
fire of the nearest forts and of field batteries, advanced
to the attack of Bagneux, and forced their way over
the entrenchments wrecked by artillery fire, into the
heart of the place, whence the defenders retired to
Fontenay, when at eleven o'clock the French 10th
Regiment of the line had also come up. Reinforced by
a fresh battalion, and supported by an effective flanking
fire from Châtillon, the Bavarians now made so firm a
stand that the enemy could make no further progress,
but began to put Bagneux in a state of defence. Meanwhile
the 4th Bavarian Division had stood to arms, and
by about 1.30 General von Bothmer (its commander)
moved it up from Sceaux and from Fontenay, and proceeded
to surround Bagneux. The barricades erected
by the enemy were carried, who however still offered
an obstinate resistance in the northern part of the
village.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>A French battalion had also made its way into
Châtillon, but the Bavarian battalion in occupation
there held its own until assistance came, and
the enemy was driven out of the place after a sharp
conflict.</p>

<p>A third brigade seized Clamart, which at that time
was not yet included in the German intrenched lines;
but it failed to climb the ascent to Moulin de la Tour,
although the defenders on the plateau above were
exposed to the fire of the forts.</p>

<p>General Vinoy had convinced himself that forces which
were a match for him confronted him at every point,
and at three o'clock he decided to break off the fight.
The French bodies of troops gradually disappeared
behind the forts, and had all vanished by dusk. The
Bavarians returned to their former fore-post positions,
and the garrison of Bagneux was increased to two
battalions.</p>

<p>All France had meanwhile been arming with eager
haste. Armies of considerable strength were being
massed at Rouen and Evreux, at Besançon, and especially
behind the Loire, of very various composition no
doubt, and above all lacking in professional officers to
drill and discipline them. Great battles were therefore
in the first instance to be avoided; the enemy was
to be constantly harassed by small engagements.
Thus, towards the end of September, General Delarue
advanced from Evreux with his "Eclaireurs de la
Seine" up to the vicinity of St. Germain. But the
5th Cavalry Division, supported by two Bavarian
battalions, drove these bands back to Dreux behind
the Eure. The woods in front of the 6th Cavalry
Division were also full of hostile parties, who were,
however, swept out without much difficulty beyond
Rambouillet to Epernon.</p>

<p>Matters looked more serious to the south of Paris,
in front of the 4th Cavalry Division, which was in
observation towards the Loire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The newly-formed French XVth Corps had assembled
at Orleans in three Divisions with a strength of 60,000
men, and it occupied the whole forest-belt on the
right bank of the river. To counteract the danger
threatening the investment from that direction, the 1st
Bavarian Corps and the 22nd Division of the XIth
had been put in march on Arpajon and Montcléry
as soon as they were freed from duty at Sedan; and
on the 6th of October they were placed, with the 2nd
Cavalry Division, under the command of General von
der Tann.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Action of Artenay.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(October 10th.)</div>


<p>When General von der Tann received instructions
to take the offensive against Orleans, he marched
on the 9th of October to the vicinity of St. Péravy
without meeting any serious opposition, and on the
10th advanced on Artenay. The 4th Cavalry Division
covered the right flank; the 2nd remained near
Pithiviers, where the enemy had collected in great
force.</p>

<p>General La Motterouge on the same day also moved
out on Artenay with the XVth French Corps, having the
wood in his rear occupied by Gardes-Mobiles; and so
the advanced guards of both sides met at a short
distance to the north of the common objective.</p>

<p>While the Bavarian light horse on the right were
driving the French cavalry before them, the infantry
deployed across the road near to Dambron. The
22nd Division marched forward on Dambron with
both Cavalry Divisions on its flanks. Under the
fire of the Bavarian batteries, the French had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
about to Artenay, where the Germans were ready to
receive them. Attacked in front and threatened by
bodies of horse, at about two o'clock, leaving their
tents standing, they began a retreat which soon degenerated
into flight. The cavalry seized four field-guns
and took above 250 prisoners. Six hundred
more, who had reached Croix Briquet, surrendered
there to the Bavarian infantry on the arrival of the
latter.</p>

<p>The German troops had made a long march; General
von der Tann therefore allowed them rest for the day
in and around Artenay, and only the advanced guard
went on to Chevilly, to pursue the march to Orleans
next day.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Engagement at Orleans.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(October 11th.)</div>


<p>On this day, the 22nd Division, for the time only
6000 strong, moved to the right flank of the advance,
and drove the French out of several villages partly
prepared for defence; it was not till about ten o'clock
that it met with serious opposition from an intrenched
position at Ormes.</p>

<p>The French Commander after the disaster at Artenay
had decided on a retreat behind the Loire, to cover
which he had halted about 15,000 men on the right
bank of the river, in a position which possessed many
essentials towards a good defence.</p>

<p>General von Wittich (commanding 22nd Division)
first sent the 44th Brigade against this position at
Ormes, and opened fire from seven batteries. The
troops of his left wing, supported by the Bavarian
right, made their way but slowly over the plain east of
the enemy's position, and various enclosures and buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
had to be stormed and taken as they advanced.
This threatening attitude of the German right, however,
shook the firmness of the defence, and, after some hours'
hard fighting, the French began to retreat. No sooner
was this observed by the Germans than two batteries
were brought up to within 800 paces, and the 83rd
Regiment stormed the entrenchments at two in the afternoon,
but with heavy loss. Detachments of the 43rd
Brigade had meanwhile reached the road in rear of
Ormes, and took 800 prisoners. But the villages, gardens
and vineyards which line the road to Orleans for
more than four miles on either side, were serious
obstacles to the advance of the Germans in close
formation, and the Division did not arrive at Petit St.
Jean till three o'clock, of which the nearest buildings
were forcibly taken possession of.</p>

<p>The Bavarian Corps, which had also met with a
stout resistance at Saran, pushed forward to Bel Air,
but with great loss, especially in the artillery. Here
the nature of the ground did not allow of the deployment
of the guns, a further attack came to a standstill,
and at half-past four the French were still stoutly holding
their own at Les Aides, till the advance of the 4th
Bavarian Brigade to Murlins threatened their line of
retreat. They made a renewed stand behind the railway
embankment, 1000 paces in front of the town, and
the railway-station and gas-works had also to be taken
by assault.</p>

<p>It was already five o'clock when General von der
Tann led his reserve, the 1st Bavarian Brigade, to the
decisive assault of Grand Ormes. The 32nd Prussian
Regiment crossed the embankment on the left flank of
the French, who now retired into the suburb of St. Jean.
The 1st Bavarian Regiment, hurrying in their rear,
was received with a hot fire at the gate of the city;
but with its officers marching at its head it reached the
market-place about seven o'clock.</p>

<p>The French hurried across the bridge over the Loire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
while the 43rd Prussian and 1st Bavarian Brigades
seized the principal buildings and the passages across
the river; but as darkness fell they desisted from
further advance and bivouacked on the open places
of the city.</p>

<p>The day had cost the Germans a loss of 900 men, the
3rd Bavarian Brigade having suffered most severely.
But their hard-won victory promptly dispelled the disquietude
of the investing armies caused by the threatening
attitude of the French; and 5000 rifles, ten
locomotives and sixty railway-carriages were welcome
prizes.</p>

<p>The French rear-guard had lost in detached combats
and retreats alone 1800 prisoners; but it had covered
the retreat of the main body of the Army of the South
for a whole day against superior forces, with praiseworthy
determination. In the open field, where skilful
handling of masses is possible, it would soon have been
defeated; but in street-fighting unflinching personal
courage is all that is needed in the defender, and the
latest recruits of the newly created French levies did
not lack that attribute.</p>

<p>On the following day the 1st Bavarian Division
took possession of the suburb of St. Marceau, on the
further side of the Loire, and advanced to the Loiret.
The 2nd Cavalry Division scouted through the Sologne,
the 4th on the right bank ranged to the westward.</p>

<p>The French XVth Corps had continued its retreat to
Salbris and Pierrefitte, behind the Sauldre.</p>

<p>It was certainly to be wished that its pursuit could
have been followed up to Vierzon and Tours, so that
the vast arsenals at the first-named town might have
been destroyed, and the Government Delegation driven
away from the other. But it must not be forgotten
that though the French forces had been discomfited at
Artenay, favoured by the nature of the locality they
had escaped utter defeat by retreat. General von der
Tann was disproportionately weak in the infantry arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and hostile masses were disclosing themselves on all
sides. A new French Army Corps, the XVIth, appeared
at Blois, below Orleans, and at Gien, above
that city; the German cavalry met with resistance
in the forest of Marchénoir and before Châteaudun;
and everywhere the inhabitants and volunteers appeared
so full of confidence that the proximity of
reinforcements was to be presumed.</p>

<p>So it behoved the Germans to restrict themselves to
the occupation of Orleans and the line of the Loire;
and for this purpose the Bavarian Corps, with the 2nd
Cavalry Division, seemed a sufficient force. The 22nd
Infantry and 4th Cavalry Divisions were recalled to
the IIIrd Army; on their return march they were
charged to disperse the volunteers who had made their
appearance at Châteaudun and Chartres.</p>

<p>General von der Tann had the bridges over the
Loiret and the Loire prepared for destruction, an
Etappen-line was established to Longjumeau, and the
Bavarian Railway Detachment set to work to restore
the line to Villeneuve.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Reduction of Soissons.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(October 15th.)</div>


<p>Soissons still hindered the further utilization of the
railway, which had been re-opened at the time of the
fall of Toul as far as Rheims. This fortress had been
bombarded by field artillery without success when the
Army of the Meuse passed by it on the march to Paris,
and since then it had only been kept under observation
until on October 6th eight Landwehr battalions, four
squadrons, two batteries, two companies of pioneers,
and four of fortress artillery made good the investment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Soissons, with its walls about 26 feet high, had complete
immunity from escalade, and the damming of the
Crise brook made it unassailable on the south. The
south-west front, on the other hand, had only a dry
ditch, with no counterscarp of masonry; here, too, the
town was commanded by Mont Marion, rising to a
height of 300 feet at a distance of little more than
a mile. Against this face of the fortress, therefore, the
artillery attack was directed at short range, when on
the 11th October there arrived from Toul 26 Prussian
siege-guns with 170 rounds for each, and 10 French
mortars. The Grand Duke of Mecklenburg took over
the command.</p>

<p>In a clear moonlight night the artillery with the help
of the infantry was brought up on to the heights of
Ste. Geneviève; the construction of the batteries about
Belleu and in Mont Marion was completed and the
arming of them effected. At six in the morning of
12th October they opened fire simultaneously.</p>

<p>The besieged answered with great spirit but with
small results, and the accurate fire of the Prussian
artillery soon subdued that of the enemy in the particular
front.</p>

<p>A narrow breach was visible by next day, and the
fire from the fortress was evidently much enfeebled;
but the commandant decidedly rejected the demand
that he should capitulate. On the 14th he increased
the number of guns on his south front, so that the
batteries on Ste. Geneviève had an arduous struggle.
The French also laboured hard along the front of the
attack to restore the severely damaged works, brought
more guns up to the ramparts, and closed the breach by
retrenchment.</p>

<p>But on the 15th these repairs were soon demolished
again by the artillery of the attack, and a breach was
made 40 paces wide and amply spread with earth. As
the fortress still kept up a brisk fire, it was determined
to bring up the field-batteries within 900 paces. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
at eight in the evening, when this operation was just
begun, the commandant opened negotiations and surrendered
the place on the Sedan terms. The garrison
marched out next morning, for the most part drunk.
A thousand Gardes-Mobiles were dismissed on parole,
3800 regulars were made prisoners.</p>

<p>The attack had cost 120 men; 128 guns and 8000
small arms became prize of war, besides vast stores of
provisions.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Storming of Châteaudun.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(October 18th.)</div>


<p>In obedience to instructions, General von Wittich
marched on Châteaudun with the 22nd Division on the
afternoon of the 18th. The French troops of the line
had already been ordered to retire on Blois, but about
1800 National Guards and volunteers still remained,
prepared under cover of barricades and walls to receive
the enemy. The infantry attack was also made more
difficult by the nature of the ground, and four batteries
had to keep up a hot fire for a long time.</p>

<p>It was not till dusk that a general assault was had
recourse to. Inside the town the enemy made a desperate
resistance. House after house had to be won, the
fighting lasted until late into the night, and a large
part of the place was set on fire. The volunteers
finally escaped, leaving 150 prisoners and abandoning
the inhabitants to their fate; and these, though they
had taken part in the struggle, were let off with a fine.</p>

<p>At noon on the 21st the Division arrived in front of
Chartres, where 10,000 French were said to have assembled.
The marine infantry and Gardes-Mobiles
advanced to the attack, but were repulsed by the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of seven batteries. The General commanding the
Division had deployed both his brigades southward of the
city, and with the assistance of his cavalry, which had
been joined by the 6th (Cavalry) Division, completely
surrounded it. The fate of Châteaudun had been a
warning to the municipal authorities, and at three
o'clock an agreement was come to by which the troops
were to be withdrawn, the National Guards to lay down
their arms, and the gates to be thrown open.</p>

<p>General Wittich's orders were to remain at Chartres
for the present, while the 6th Cavalry Division was to
occupy Maintenon, and so cover the investing army to
the west.</p>

<p>Not less fervid was the rush to arms in the north, in
Picardy and Normandy. The Saxon Cavalry Division,
supported by detachments of the Army of the Meuse,
had in the early part of October driven the franctireurs
and Gardes-Mobiles beyond the Oise and the
Epte on Amiens, taking some hundreds of prisoners.
But fresh swarms were constantly coming on, and had
to be attacked at Breteuil, Montdidier, and Etrêpagny,
so that no less than eleven battalions, twenty-four
squadrons, and four batteries, were by degrees employed
in this direction for the protection of the besieging
force. But by the end of the month the French
forces were so systematically organized and in so great
strength, that for the time the Germans had to confine
themselves to holding on the defensive the line of the
Epte.</p>

<p>To the south-east also, in the forest-land of Fontainebleau,
hostilities were prosecuted by the volunteers,
particularly against requisition-parties of cavalry; and
from Nangis obstruction was threatened to the transport
of the siege-guns. A small force of Würtemberg
troops seized Montereau, which, though barricaded, was
not defended; the inhabitants gave up their arms, and
the detachment marched on Nogent. This town was
held by a large body of Gardes-Mobiles. After breaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the walls of the churchyard, the Würtembergers,
in the face of a hot fire, made their way into the place.
The French still offered a stout resistance in its interior,
but finally retired on Troyes, leaving 600 dead and
wounded. The small flying column rejoined its
Division, having traversed over 126 miles in six days.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Sortie Against Malmaison.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(October 21st.)</div>


<p>The French capital had now been invested for more
than four weeks, and it seemed not impossible, because
of the long continuance of inactivity, that it might be
brought to surrender by famine. All the sorties hitherto
attempted had only had for their object to drive
the enemy from the closest vicinity; a new effort was
to aim at greater results. The project was to cross the
Seine below Paris at Bezons and Carrières, and to make
a simultaneous attack on the positions of the IVth
Prussian Corps on the heights of Argenteuil from the
south, and from St.-Denis from the east. A march on
Rouen by Pontoise was to follow, into a district not
yet altogether exhausted of resources. The Army of
the Loire was also to proceed thither by railway by
way of Le Mans, and so there would be massed in that
region an army of 250,000 men.</p>

<p>The Prussian Vth Corps, it was true, stood right on
the flank of such an advance across the Seine; its
outposts had several times been seen in Rueil. As a
preliminary step, General Ducrot undertook to force
back this body with 10,000 men and 120 field-guns.
Then an intrenched line from Valérien to Carrières
would close the peninsula against interference from the
southward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps, in the face of much-dreaded "public
opinion" and the growing restlessness of political
parties in Paris, it was more the urgency to be doing
something than any serious hope of success which gave
rise to such far-reaching schemes. Considerable difficulties
had to be met in attacking the enemy's lines, and
greater must inevitably arise if the attack should
succeed. It was vain to think of bringing through the
miles-long trains which are indispensable for victualling
an army. Serious embarrassment would ensue when
the troops had consumed the three days' rations they
would carry with them. To live on the country the
army must disperse itself; but with the enemy at its
heels close concentration was indispensable. And, in
any case, it is hard to see what would have been gained
by withdrawing from Paris the forces which had been
assembled for the defence of the capital. Success could
only have been hoped for if an army from without had
been so near as to be able immediately to give the hand
to the troops marching out.</p>

<p>However, on the 21st of October, after Mont Valérien
had all the morning kept up a seemingly ineffective fire,
General Ducrot advanced at about one o'clock to attack
the position of the Prussian 19th Brigade whose supports
held the line Bougival&mdash;Jonchère&mdash;Fohlenkoppel.
Fourteen French field-batteries deployed on either side
of Rueil and about the southern base of Valérien; the
infantry advanced in five columns behind this artillery
front.</p>

<p>On the German side only two batteries could at first
engage in the unequal duel, and one of these near the
Villa Metternich had very soon to retire. The French
guns advanced rightward to within 1400 paces of Bougival,
and at three o'clock four companies of Zouaves
rushed out of Rueil. Being received with a hot fire,
they wheeled into the park of Malmaison, and without
opposition seized the Château of Buzanval and the
eastern slope of the deep-cut ravine of Cucufa. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
here one of their batteries was brought up into the
fighting-line to support them.</p>

<p>While the main body of the 9th Division advanced
from Versailles on Vaucresson, the 10th deployed
against the ravine and at Villa Metternich. The infantry
fire lasted for a full hour, and wrought the
French much loss. When at about four o'clock they
seemed sufficiently shaken, and a reinforcement of the
Guard Landwehr had come up from St. Germain on the
left, the German left wing advanced from Bougival and
over the height of Jonchère, forced its way into
Malmaison in spite of violent opposition, and followed
the retreating Zouaves as far as Rueil. The right wing
at the same time having turned the head of the Cucufa
ravine, charged against its eastern slope, drove out the
enemy, seized the battery of two guns, and occupied
the Château of Buzanval.</p>

<p>The French now retired on all sides, firing ceased by
six o'clock, and the 10th Division, which had repulsed
the enemy's assaults single-handed, re-established its
previous fore-post line.</p>

<p>The struggle had cost the Germans 400 men. The
French, on the other hand, had in this luckless enterprise
left 500 dead and wounded, and 120 prisoners.</p>

<p>Soon after this affair the French began to throw up
entrenchments within 800 paces of the line of the
Guard Corps; and in the early morning of the 28th,
General Bellemare, under cover of the darkness,
advanced on Le Bourget with a force of several
battalions.</p>

<p>The German company in occupation there, taken
completely by surprise, could only retire before such
overwhelming numbers, to Pont Iblon and Blanc Mesnil.
The French promptly barricaded themselves in the
place and prepared it for an obstinate defence. A
German battalion made a vain attempt that evening to
drive them out; it was repulsed with heavy loss.
Equally unsuccessful next day was the fire of thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
field-guns directed against the place from Pont Iblon.
Then, however, the Crown Prince of Saxony issued
imperative orders to the Guard Corps to recapture Le
Bourget without delay.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Storming of Le Bourget.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(October 30th.)</div>


<p>Accordingly on October 30th, nine battalions of the
2nd Guard-Division and five batteries, under the command
of Lieutenant-General von Budritzki,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> were assembled
at Dugny, Pont Iblon and Blanc Mesnil for a concentric
attack on Le Bourget. The artillery in action
along the bank of the Morée inundation opened the
attack at about eight in the morning, and then the infantry
went forward. The terrain was perfectly open,
and the advance was under fire, not merely from Le
Bourget, but also from the heavy guns of the forts.
Nevertheless the Grenadier Battalion of the Queen
Elizabeth Regiment, at the head of the central column,
at nine o'clock made a successful assault, charging
over the barricade at the northern end of the village,
and entering it through a breach in the wall promptly
made by the pioneers. The Emperor Francis Grenadier
Regiment advanced against its western face and took
possession of the park. A fierce street-fight ensued on
a further advance into the village, in the course of
which there fell the commanders of both regiments,
Colonels von Zaluskowski and Count Waldersee. The
walled farmsteads left of the main street, were stormed
one after another in spite of a determined defence; the
windows of the church, high up in the walls as they
were, were broken in and scaled, and a hand-to-hand
fight raged furiously inside the sacred building. The
Guard Rifle-Battalion forced its way into the glass-works.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>
<p>At half-past nine the French attempted to bring up
into Le Bourget reinforcements from Aubervillers and
Drancy; but the left German column had meanwhile
seized the railway-embankment, placed a detachment
of the Emperor Alexander Regiment to hold it, and
was forcing its way into the southern quarter of the
village. Two batteries had taken up position on the
Mollette brook, and their fire drove back the enemy
and even compelled him to evacuate Drancy.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the French still held the buildings on
the north side of the Mollette. These were now
assailed from the south. The 4th Company of the
Emperor Alexander Regiment crossed the stream and
forced its way through a breach made by the sappers
into the farmstead in which the enemy's main force
was gathered. The defenders had to be quelled with
the bayonet and with clubbed arms, and here the
French Colonel de Baroche met his death.</p>

<p>Although by this time&mdash;eleven o'clock&mdash;all the three
attacking columns had struck hands in the heart of Le
Bourget, the enemy continued the struggle in detached
houses and gardens with embittered desperation till
the afternoon, while all the forts on the north front
of Paris overwhelmed the place with shell-fire. It was
not till half-past one that the troops of the attack could
withdraw by companies to their respective quarters.
Two battalions remained to garrison Le Bourget.</p>

<p>The desperate resistance of the French showed how
important they considered their retention of this post.
Its success had cost the 2nd (Guard) Division 500 men.
The enemy's loss is not known, but 1200 prisoners
were taken. This new disaster added to the dissatisfaction
of the inhabitants of Paris. The revolutionary
factions, which at all times lurk in the French capital,
came ominously to the front.</p>

<p>Highly-coloured reports could no longer conceal
utter lack of results; the authority of the Government
was steadily on the wane. It was accused of incapacity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
nay, of treason. Noisy mobs clamoured for
arms, and even a part of the National Guard took part
in the tumult. The Hôtel de Ville was surrounded by
a throng shouting "Vive la Commune!" and though
other troops dispersed these gatherings, the ringleaders,
though well known, went unpunished.</p>

<p>On the 31st of October uproarious masses again
paraded the streets. As General Trochu had forbidden
the sentries at the Hôtel de Ville to use their
arms, the rebels forced their way in. The Ministers
were their prisoners till the evening, when some battalions
which remained staunch liberated them.</p>

<p>Monsieur Thiers, who had returned from his fruitless
tour among the European Courts, thought the time
had come for re-opening negotiations with Versailles.
On the part of the Germans there was still the readiness
to grant an armistice, but it was naturally impossible
to accede to the condition demanded by the French, that
the city should be re-provisioned, and so hostilities had
to take their course.</p>

<p>At this time, towards the end of October, the situation
on the Moselle had assumed an aspect which
essentially modified that of the whole war.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<div class="right"><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></div>

<p>By the exchange of German prisoners for French
who had fought at Sedan, details of the disaster which
had befallen France in that battle were currently
known in Metz. But Marshal Bazaine declared that
the Army of the Rhine would continue to defend
the country against the invaders, and maintain
public order against the evil passions of disloyal men&mdash;a
resolution which certainly could be interpreted
in more ways than one. It would have been
eminently satisfactory to the Germans, politically
speaking, if there had been in France an available<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
power, apart from the pretentious but feeble Government
in Paris, with which to come to an understanding
as regarded the termination of the war. Permission
was therefore given for the admission to
Metz of a person representing himself to have a commission
from the exiled Imperial family. As he was
unable to authenticate himself in this capacity to the
satisfaction of Marshal Bazaine, General Bourbaki was
allowed to pass through the German lines that he
might betake himself to London, where, however, the
Empress Eugénie declined all intervention in the
already so disastrous affairs of France. The General
then placed his services at the disposal of the National
Defence Government at Tours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the army which had been beleaguered
in Metz since the day of Noisseville maintained a
waiting attitude. The necessary supplies for 70,000
inhabitants, including the country-folk who had taken
refuge in the city, had originally been enough to last
three months and a half, those for the regular garrison
were calculated for about five months; but for the
Army of the Rhine there was sustenance in store for
only forty-one days, and there was forage for only
twenty-five.</p>

<p>Certainly it was possible to supplement the supplies
for the troops by purchase from the abundant stores of
the citizens; but ere long smaller rations of bread
were served out and horses were being slaughtered to
furnish animal food, so that most of the cavalry regiments
were reduced to two squadrons.</p>

<p>On the German side, the service of supplying
197,326 men and 33,136 horses was one of great difficulty.
The outbreak of cattle-plague in Germany
restricted the importation of live beasts to those purchased
in Holland and Belgium. The meat rations had
to be supplemented by tinned provisions; and increased
rations of oats had to take the place of hay and straw.</p>

<p>The losses of the army had hitherto been made good
from the reserves, but the transport of the prisoners from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Sedan alone required the services of fourteen battalions
of the force blockading Metz. Thus it had not
yet been possible to provide sufficient shelter for the
troops near the wide extension of the entrenched line.
Raw, rainy weather had come on early in the season,
and a fourth part of the men were still roofless; so that
by degrees the sick in hospital reached the alarming
number of 40,000.</p>

<p>Although fifty heavy guns had been brought up
from Germany, they were useless for the bombardment
of Metz, since in consequence of the superior calibre of
the fortress artillery they could only be fired at night,
and with frequent change of position. There was
nothing for it but to hope for the best, and have
patience.</p>

<p>For four weeks already had the besieged been consuming
their stores. To replenish those in some degree,
and at the same time to revive the spirit of the troops
by active measures, the Marshal decided on fetching
in all the provisions to be found in the villages inside
the line of the German investment, under cover of a
sortie.</p>

<p>At noon on September 22nd Fort St. Julien opened
a heavy fire on the outposts of the Ist Corps. Strong
bodies of infantry then advanced on the villages to the
eastward, drove in the picquets of the enemy, and returned
to Metz with the stores which had been seized.
But a similar attempt made next afternoon on the villages
to the north was less successful. Most of the waggons
had to return empty, under the fire of the Prussian
batteries quickly brought up into position. Finally,
on the 27th, a sortie for the same purpose was made to
the southward, which led to a series of small conflicts
and the capture in Peltre of a German company,
which was surrounded by a much stronger force. A
simultaneous sally on the left bank of the Moselle was
baffled by the fire of the alert artillery of the besieging
force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Thionville, on the north of Metz, had hitherto only
been kept under observation by a small force, which
could not hinder the garrison from scouring the country
as far as the neighbouring frontier, taking many prisoners,
seizing fifty waggon-loads of supplies, and even
diverting into the fortress a whole train of provision-trucks
while passing by the now restored railway from
Luxemburg.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the Army of the Rhine would have
found in Thionville an important rallying-point at the
end of its first day's march, if the blockade of Metz
could have been broken through. Prince Frederick
Charles, realizing this, took care to strengthen the
investing lines to the north, on the right bank of the
Moselle. On October 1st the Xth Corps took up the
position hitherto held by the Reserve Division Kummer,
which was transferred to the left bank of the river.
The Ist, VIIth, and VIIIth Corps closed up to the right,
and the IInd occupied the space between the Seille and
the Moselle; the troops before Thionville were also reinforced.</p>

<p>The Marshal had really once more determined to
break out to the northward, and that on both banks
of the river. New bridges were constructed behind
St. Julien and from the island of Chambière, the
nearest German outposts on the north and west of Metz
were pushed back by a series of daily skirmishes.
Under cover of the fire of the forts the French established
themselves firmly in Lessy and Ladonchamps.
The troops to be left in Metz were expressly selected;
the others tested as to their marching powers.
Light-signals were arranged with Thionville, and all
preparations made for a sortie on the 7th.</p>

<p>Then the French commander suddenly changed his
mind, and the proposed enterprise collapsed into a
foraging expedition.</p>

<p>For this, indeed, large forces were set in motion;
the Guard Voltigeur Division, the VIth Corps, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the IVth in the forest of Woippy. The movement was
also to be supported by the IIIrd Corps on the right
bank of the river.</p>

<p>Four hundred waggons were in readiness to carry
off the stores from the large farms lying north of
Ladonchamps.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Sortie from Metz against Bellevue.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(October 7th.)</div>


<p>Although the start from Woippy planned for eleven
o'clock, was not effected till one, the Landwehr companies
on outpost duty were driven in by superior
numbers, and as they defended their positions till their
ammunition was exhausted, they also lost a considerable
number of prisoners. But the artillery of the
Landwehr Division prevented the removal of the
stores; the 5th Division advancing from Norroy struck
the left flank of the French attack and drove the enemy
back on Bellevue, where a stationary fight developed
itself.</p>

<p>The French IIIrd Corps advanced on the right bank
of the Moselle against Malroy and Noisseville. Here,
too, the outpost line fell back; but behind it stood the
Xth and Ist Corps, ready for action. The respective
Corps commanders at once perceived that this attack
was only a feint. Although threatened himself, General
von Voigts-Rhetz sent his 38th Brigade across the
Moselle at Argancy by half-past two to assist the
Landwehr Division, and when General von Manteuffel
forwarded him supports to Charly, the 37th Brigade
followed.</p>

<p>No sooner had the first reinforcements arrived than
General von Kummer on his side took the offensive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
recaptured the farmsteads from the enemy after a
sharp struggle just as the latter were about to retire,
and then, supported on the right by part of the 5th
Division, moved on Bellevue at about six in the evening.
Ladonchamps, however, still remained in the
hands of the French. Late in the evening the 19th
and Reserve Divisions advanced on this place. The
premises of the château, which were surrounded by a
moat, were carefully intrenched and strongly defended
by infantry and guns. The darkness precluded effective
artillery action, and the attack failed; but all the
other points previously held by the Germans were re-occupied.</p>

<p>The day had cost the Prussians 1700 killed and
wounded, besides 500 reported missing. The French
loss was given out to be no more than 1193.</p>

<p>This attempt on the part of the French might be
regarded as tentative, and preliminary only to a real
effort to break through; perhaps it was so intended.
The German troops therefore remained in the positions
they had occupied at the close of the fighting,
in expectation of renewed hostilities on the morrow.</p>

<p>The forts in fact opened a heavy fire on the farm-buildings
early on the 8th, while the German batteries
directed their fire on Ladonchamps. Strong columns
also advanced along the right bank of the Moselle, but
nowhere attempted a serious attack. The Prussian
troops therefore presently retired to their quarters.</p>

<p>The artillery duel was carried on for the next few
days, but with diminished energy. Constant rain
made all field operations very difficult, and increased
the sufferings of the men on both sides. In Metz the
lack of victuals was becoming very painfully felt. So
early as on the 8th the commandant had announced
that his stores would not last longer than for twelve
days. A council of war, held on the 10th, was, however,
of opinion that the greatest service the Army of
the Rhine could do to France was to hold out as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
long as possible, since it thus continued to detain a
hostile army under the walls of Metz.</p>

<p>The Marshal now sent General Boyer to negotiate at
Versailles, but his instructions were to demand a free
exit for the army and explicitly to refuse the terms of
the Sedan capitulation.</p>

<p>The state of affairs in Metz was perfectly well
known to the Germans. The number of men who
were taken willing prisoners while digging potatoes
increased every day. They reported that disturbances
had broken out in the city, in which even part of the
soldiers had taken part, and that the commander-in-chief
had been compelled to proclaim the Republic.
And since the Empress had declared that she would
never give her consent to any diminution of French
territory, no further political negotiations were possible
with the chiefs of the Army of the Rhine.</p>

<p>On the 20th the distribution of stores came to an
end within the fortress, and the troops thenceforth for
the most part subsisted on horseflesh. The original
stock of 20,000 horses was reduced by a thousand a
day. The want of bread and salt was severely felt,
and the soaked, deep ground made living in camp
almost unendurable.</p>

<p>After the failure of the negotiations at Versailles,
the imperative necessity of entering into negotiations
with the Headquarter of the besieging army was
recognized by a council of war held on the 24th.</p>

<p>The first interview had no result, as the Marshal
still stipulated for free egress on condition of withdrawing
to Algiers, or the alternative of an armistice
with the reprovisioning of Metz. On the German side
the surrender of the fortress and the march out of the
garrison as prisoners of war were insisted on, and on
these conditions the capitulation was signed on the
evening of the 27th of October.</p>

<div class="center">(October 27th.)<a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></div>


<p>On the morning of the 29th<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Prussian flags were
hoisted on the great outworks of Metz. At one o'clock
the French garrison marched out by six roads in
perfect silence and correct military formation.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> At
each specified position a Prussian Army Corps stood
to receive the prisoners, who were immediately placed
in bivouacs previously prepared, and supplied with
food. The officers were allowed to keep their swords
and to return to Metz; provisions were immediately
sent in.</p>

<p>Marshal Bazaine set out for Cassel.</p>

<p>In the course of the day the 26th Brigade occupied
Metz. The city had suffered no injury, but the
state of the camps showed what the troops had suffered
during the siege of seventy-two days.</p>

<p>The Germans during that time had lost 240 officers
and 5500 men in killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Six thousand French officers and 167,000 men were
taken prisoners, beside 20,000 sick who could not be
at once removed, about 200,000 in all.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Fifty-six
Imperial eagles, 622 field and 876 fortress guns, 72
mitrailleuses and 260,000 rifles fell into the hands of
the Germans.</p>

<p>The prisoners were transported by way of Trèves
and Saarbrücken, escorted by Landwehr battalions,
and as these would have also to guard them when in
Germany, their return to field service was not to be
reckoned on.

<h2><span class="smcap">New Distribution of the Army.</span></h2>


<p>The capitulation of Metz, which Prince Frederick
Charles had brought about under such serious difficulties,
materially improved the prospects of the war for
Germany.</p>

<p>At the Royal Headquarter at Versailles, even before
the catastrophe but in confident anticipation of it,
decisions had been arrived at as to the respective
destinations of the forces it would release for service,
and communicated in advance to the superior Commanders.</p>

<p>The Ist, VIIth and VIIIth Corps, with the 3rd
Cavalry Division, were thenceforth to constitute the
Ist Army, under the command of General von Manteuffel.
Its orders were to advance into the Compiègne
region and cover the investment of Paris on
the north. But apart from these orders it had various
other duties to fulfil; it was to occupy Metz and lay
siege to Thionville and Montmédy.</p>

<p>The IInd, IIIrd, IXth and Xth Corps, with the 1st
Cavalry Division, were to constitute the IInd Army
under the command of Prince Frederick Charles, which
was ordered to advance on the Middle Loire.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Operations of the XIVth Corps in the
South-East.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(October.)</div>


<p>Since the fall of Strasburg the newly-formed
XIVth Corps had been employed in safe-guarding the
communications between the German armies standing
fast respectively before Metz and before Paris.
General von Werder had no great battle to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
forward to, but a succession of small engagements.
To prepare his four infantry brigades for independent
action under such circumstances, he detailed artillery
and cavalry to each. In this formation the Corps
crossed the Vosges by the two roads through Schirmeck
and Barr, driving swarms of hostile Franctireurs
out of the narrow passes without material delay.
But on emerging from the mountains it at once met
with serious opposition.</p>

<p>The French General Cambriels had been at Epinal
with about 30,000 men ever since the beginning of
October, and under cover of this force numerous
battalions of National Guards and Gardes-Mobiles had
been formed in the south of France.</p>

<p>On the 6th, General von Degenfeld<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> with the advanced
guard of the Baden force approached St. Dié,
marching on both banks of the Meurthe. The weak
column was beset on all sides by far superior forces, yet
after repeated attacks it succeeded in taking the villages
which the enemy had been holding.</p>

<p>The struggle, which lasted seven hours, ended with
the eccentric retreat of the enemy to Rambervillers and
Bruyères. It had cost the Germans 400 and the French
1400 men. The Baden force bivouacked on the field,
and presently found that the French had evacuated St.
Dié. General Cambriels had, in fact, collected all his
available forces in intrenched positions about Bruyères.
The Baden Brigade advanced on these on the 11th,
drove the Gardes-Mobiles and volunteers from the outlying
villages, climbed the heights on both sides of the
town, and forced its way into it with inconsiderable
loss. The enemy retired to the southward on Remiremont.</p>

<p>From the small resistance hitherto made by the
French, though so far superior in numbers, General
von Werder assumed that they would hardly make a
stand before reaching Besançon, so he immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
countermanded further pursuit, though somewhat early
in the day, and concentrated his forces on Epinal,
which place was taken possession of by the Germans
after insignificant fighting. From thence an etappen-route
and telegraph-line were opened to Lunéville and
Nancy, magazines were formed, and the trains, which
were following the Corps from Saverne by Blamont to
Baccarat, were brought up. The railway along the
Moselle remained, however, useless for a long time, in
consequence of injury done to it by the enemy.</p>

<p>General von Werder was now anxious, in accordance
with his instructions of September 30th, to march on
the Upper Seine by Neufchâteau, but a telegram from
the supreme Headquarter directed him in the first
instance to complete the rout of the enemy in his
vicinity under General Cambriels.</p>

<p>The Corps accordingly put itself in motion forthwith
through Conflans and Luxeuil on Vesoul, and
information was received that the enemy had in fact
halted at the Ognon, taken up quarters there, and
received reinforcements. General von Werder determined
to attack at once. He ordered that the passages
over the river should be secured on the 22nd; further
decisions were postponed till reports should be brought
in. The 1st Baden Brigade came up on the right by
nine o'clock, reaching Marnay and Pin without having
encountered the French; it secured the bridges there,
and then halted to await further orders. On the left
flank the franctireurs were driven out of the woods
by the 3rd Brigade, which also stormed Perrouse, and
at about half-past two seized the bridge over the
Ognon at Voray. In the centre the head of the
advanced guard of the 2nd Brigade entered Etuz after
a slight skirmish, but had to withdraw at eleven
o'clock to the northern bank, before the enemy's flank
attack from out the woods. Afterwards, when the
main force came up and the artillery opened fire,
the place was taken for the second time at one o'clock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
But a prolonged fire-fight ensued, the French making
an obstinate stand in front of the passage over the
river at Cussey. Orders had already been sent to the
1st Brigade to move up on the southern bank from Pin
on the enemy's flank and rear. But it could not reach
the ground until six o'clock, when the battle was over.
When two batteries had made good the possession of
the bridge over the Ognon under a heavy fire, the
enemy hastily retired, pursued by the Badeners; he
was again driven out of his rearward positions, but
when night fell he still remained in possession of several
points in front of Besançon.</p>

<p>The Germans had lost 120 men, the French 150 and
200 prisoners. In opposition to Gambetta, who was
himself in Besançon, General Cambriels obstinately
resisted every order to renew the advance, and would
only consent to maintain his strong position under the
walls of the fortress.</p>

<p>Parties sent out to reconnoitre on the right reported
the presence of French forces at Dôle and Auxonne,
the advance-guard probably of an "Army of the Vosges"
under Garibaldi, which was assembling on the
Doubs. General von Werder disregarded it, and on
the 26th moved his Corps to Dampierre and Gray.
Beyond the Saône all the roads were broken up, the
woods choked with abatis, and the whole population in
arms. But the franctireurs and Gardes-Mobiles were
dispersed without difficulty, and a column marching
without any precautions was driven back on the Vingeanne
brook, where 15 officers and 430 men laid down
their arms.</p>

<p>From further reports and the information of the prisoners
it was known that Dijon was strongly garrisoned.
In expectation, therefore, of an attack from that side,
the XIVth Corps was assembled behind the Vingeanne,
whence early on October 30th General von Beyer<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
marched on Dijon with the 1st and 3rd Brigades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Filled with apprehension by recent events, the National
Guards in Dijon had already laid down their
arms, the Gardes-Mobiles and the line troops of the
garrison had retreated southwards; but the inhabitants
were assured that the forces would be brought back to
defend them. About 8000 men were available, but
they insisted on their commander pledging himself to
fight only outside the city.</p>

<p>The advanced posts on the Tille were driven in by the
Baden advanced guard; the village of St. Apollinaire
and the neighbouring heights were taken with a rush at
noon, in spite of a hot fire. Meanwhile the main body
had come up, and at three o'clock six German batteries
opened fire. The vineyards and numerous farmsteads
in the neighbourhood of Dijon, and especially the
strongly barricaded park south of the city, gave the
defence a great advantage. Nevertheless, the Baden
infantry continued its steady advance and closed in on
the northern and eastern suburbs by a wide encircling
movement.</p>

<p>Here a fierce combat ensued, in which the inhabitants
took part. House after house had to be stormed,
but the attack came to a stand at the deep-cut bed of
the Suzon brook, which borders the city on the east. It
was four o'clock, and the impending struggle could not
be ended before dark. General von Beyer therefore
broke off the fight; the battalions were withdrawn and
retired to quarters in the adjacent villages; only the
artillery still kept up its fire.</p>

<p>The Germans had lost about 150 and the French 100
men; but of the latter 200 were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>In the course of the night a deputation came out
to beg that the town might be spared; its members
undertook to furnish supplies for 20,000 men, and to
guarantee the good behaviour of the inhabitants.
The Baden troops took possession of Dijon on the 31st.</p>

<p>Meanwhile fresh instructions had reached General
von Werder. They prescribed that he was to protect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the left flank of the IInd Army advancing to the Loire
and at the same time to cover Alsace and the troops
besieging Belfort, where two reserve Divisions had now
arrived. It was intended that the XIVth Corps, while
retaining its hold on Dijon, should also move to Vesoul
and hold in check from there the gathering of hostile
troops round Besançon and at Langres. Some offensive
movement on Châlons<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and Dôle was also insisted on.</p>

<p>General von Werder's position was more difficult
than was recognized at Versailles. At Besançon alone
there were 45,000 French troops, under the command
of a new leader, General Crouzat. Garibaldi had collected
12,000 between Dôle and Auxonne; lower down
the Saône valley a new Corps was being formed of
18,000 men, and 12,000 National Guards and Gardes-Mobiles
threatened from Langres the flank of the isolated
German Corps. But the French, instead of
attacking this slender force with overwhelming numbers&mdash;spread
out as it was over a distance of fifty-six miles
from Lure to Dijon and Gray&mdash;were haunted by the
apprehension that the Germans, reinforced from Metz,
might be intending an attack on Lyons. General
Crouzat, leaving a strong garrison in Besançon, consequently
marched to Chagny, where up to November
12th he was reinforced from the south to a strength of
50,000 men. The Garibaldian volunteers moved up to
Autun to protect Bourges.</p>

<p>General von Werder meanwhile had occupied Vesoul,
and had the south face of the city put in a state of
defence.</p>

<p>The only event of importance during the course of
October which remains to be mentioned was the action
taken against the French forts lying rearward of the
German armies.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the month the newly constituted
4th Reserve Division, of fifteen battalions, eight squadrons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
thirty-six guns, and a company of fortress-pioneers,
had assembled in Baden, and crossed the
Rhine at Neuenburg. The vicinity was first cleared
of franctireurs, Mülhausen was occupied, and, by the
express desire of its municipal authorities, the excited
artisan inhabitants were disarmed. General von
Schmeling (commanding the Division) was instructed
to besiege Neu-Breisach and Schlettstadt, and at once
set about the investment of each of these places with a
brigade. On October 7th the East Prussian Landwehr
invested Breisach, and the field-batteries shelled the
place, but without effect. The other brigade, having
been forced to detach considerably, reached Schlettstadt
very weak, but was reinforced by Etappen troops
to such extent that the place was invested with 8
battalions, 2 squadrons, and 2 batteries. At the same
time 12 companies of fortress-artillery and 4 companies
of pioneers arrived from Strasburg with the necessary
siege material, and an artillery park of fifty-six heavy
guns was established at St. Pilt; the engineer park
was located at Kinzheim.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Reduction of Schlettstadt.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(October 24th.)</div>


<p>At the beginning of the blockade, inundations and
marsh-land rendered Schlettstadt, a fortified town of
10,000 inhabitants, unapproachable on the east and
south, and partly on the north. The place itself, perfectly
safe from storm, with high walls and a wet ditch,
was armed with 120 guns, but garrisoned with only
2000 men, for the most part Gardes-Mobiles. There
was a deficiency of safe casemates, and on the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
front vineyards and hedgerows favoured the near
approach of assaults, while the railway embankment
was a ready-made protecting wall for the construction
of the first parallel. To divert the attention of the
besieged from this front of attack, a battery was constructed
on the 20th at the Kappel Mill on the south-east,
from which fire was opened on the barracks and
magazine in the town, and on the sluice which maintained
the inundation. By the evening of the 21st,
the infantry posts had advanced to within 400 paces
of the glacis, and the construction of the first parallel
was proceeded with that night, immediately behind
the railway, as well as of emplacements for six
batteries within 1230 feet from the ramparts. The
garrison fired in the dark on the entire field of
attack, but almost without effect. By the morning
the trenches were two feet wide and three and a half
feet deep, and 20 heavy guns and 8 mortars were ready
to open fire. A hot artillery duel now began with
the fortress, which replied very steadily. The battery
at the mill subjected the west front to a telling
reverse fire, and several guns and embrasures were
severely damaged. The town was fired at several
points, and the defenders' fire gradually ceased.
During the night, which was very stormy, the batteries
of the attack kept up their fire, the parallel was
widened and two new batteries were begun.</p>

<p>At daybreak of the 24th the white flag was seen
flying, and a capitulation was forthwith signed, by
which Schlettstadt surrendered with its garrison and
war-material. The commandant begged the Germans
to take possession at once, as the greatest disorder
reigned within the town. The public buildings were
being plundered by the mob and the drunken soldiery,
and a powder-magazine was actually on fire. The
German battalions promptly restored order, extinguished
the flames, and took away the prisoners.
Seven thousand stand of arms fell into German hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
besides the fortress artillery and a large quantity of
stores. The siege had cost the victors only twenty men.
Schlettstadt was occupied by Etappen troops, and
the battalions released from duty there marched into
southern Alsace, three of them going to strengthen the
siege of Breisach, which was now being proceeded
with.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Reduction of Breisach.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(November 10th.)</div>


<p>This fortress, lying in the plain and of very symmetrical
shape, was proof against a coup-de-main
because of its ditches, which were dry indeed, but faced
with solid masonry. The garrison of over 5000 men
had well-protected quarters in the bomb-proof casemates
of the ravelins. Fort Mortier, standing near the Rhine,
and constructed for independent defence, effectually
commanded the ground over which the intended attack
must be made on the north-west front of the fortress.
Therefore 12 heavy guns were brought up from Rastatt
to Alt Breisach, where the right bank of the Rhine
commands the fort at effective range.</p>

<p>It was not till near the end of October that the siege-guns
arrived before New Breisach from Schlettstadt,
and when the infantry had closed up and all preparations
were complete, fire from 24 heavy guns was
opened on the fortress on November 2nd from Wolfgantzen,
Biesheim and Alt Breisach.</p>

<p>By three o'clock a large part of the town was on
fire, and detachments of infantry were skirmishing
with the French posts at the foot of the glacis. Fort
Mortier had suffered exceptionally severely. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
an attempt to storm it was repulsed, but at
six o'clock it capitulated, an utter ruin. Only one
gun remained in serviceable condition. Two new
mortar batteries were erected to shell the main
fortress, the defence became perceptibly more feeble,
and on November 10th Breisach surrendered on the
same terms as Schlettstadt, but the garrison was
allowed to march out with the honours of war. The
fortifications were almost uninjured, but the town was
for the most part burnt down or severely damaged.
The success had cost the Germans only 70 men; 108
guns, 6000 small arms and large quantities of stores
fell into their hands.</p>

<p>While these strongholds in Alsace-Lorraine were
thus being reduced, Verdun still intercepted the line of
railway which formed the shortest line of communication
with Germany.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Taking of Verdun.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(November 9th.)</div>


<p>This place, too, was made quite storm-free by high
walls and deep wet ditches; but, on the other hand, it
was surrounded by a ring of heights whence it could
be seen into, and at the foot of these heights villages
and vineyards favoured an approach to within a short
distance of the outworks.</p>

<p>The fortress was armed with 140 guns and abundantly
victualled, and the garrison, which had been
supplemented by escaped prisoners, was 6000 strong.
A bombardment by field-artillery had already proved
perfectly ineffectual. For a long time Verdun was only
under observation, at first by cavalry, and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
by a small mixed force. At the end of September the
65th Regiment and twelve companies of Landwehr
assembled under General von Gayl before the east face
of the place. It was not till October 9th that two companies
of fortress-artillery brought up some French
heavy guns from Toul and Sedan. The infantry now
advanced to within a few hundred paces of the west
and north fronts and there established itself. Under
this cover the construction of the batteries was begun
on the evening of October 12th.</p>

<p>The heavy ground after the rain, and the rocky
subsoil very thinly covered, made the work uncommonly
difficult, yet by next morning fifty-two
guns were able to open fire. But the fortress replied
with such effect that before noon two batteries on the
Côte de Hayvaux on the westward were reduced to
inaction.</p>

<p>In the course of this three days' artillery engagement,
15 German guns were placed out of action,
the artillery lost 60 men and the infantry 40. The
disabled guns on the walls of the enemy were constantly
replaced by fresh ones.</p>

<p>The garrison, which was far stronger than the
besiegers, now assumed the offensive. During the
stormy night of the 19th&mdash;20th, the picquets on the
Hayvaux were overpowered, and the guns in the
battery there were spiked. On the 28th a sortie in
greater force was made. The French climbed up Mont
St. Michel, lying northward of Verdun, and destroyed
the breast-works and bomb-proofs of the batteries,
from which, however, the guns had been withdrawn.
Another body pushed up the Hayvaux, and as the
soaked state of the ground prevented the guns from
being withdrawn, they were totally disabled. The
villages in the neighbourhood were also occupied by
the French.</p>

<p>It was now evident that the means hitherto brought
to bear on the reduction of Verdun were quite inadequate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
But after the fall of Metz the Ist Army was
able to send up reinforcements. At the end of the
month 5 battalions and 2 companies of pioneers and
several of artillery arrived, and also a quantity of
German material.</p>

<p>The siege park now numbered 102 guns with abundant
ammunition, and preparations were at once made
for a regular attack.</p>

<p>But for this the garrison did not wait. After an
armistice had been granted, the place capitulated on
November 8th, in virtue of which the garrison, with
exception of the local National Guards, became prisoners
of war. The officers were dismissed on parole
with their swords and personal property, and it was
agreed that the war-material in store should be given
back on the conclusion of peace.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Advance of Ist and IInd Armies up to
Mid November.</span></h2>


<p>The Ist Army having in addition undertaken the
siege of Mézières, the 1st Infantry Division moved
on that place, and the 3rd Brigade, sent forward by
railway to Soissons, on November 15th set about the
siege of the small fortress of La Fère. The rest of the
Ist Corps reached Rethel on the same day, the VIIIth
Rheims, and the 3rd Cavalry Division Tagnon, between
the two places named. The VIIth Corps was still
fully engaged in guarding the prisoners and in besieging
Thionville and Montmédy.</p>

<p>Of the IInd Army the IXth Corps and 1st Cavalry
Division reached Troyes on the 10th, the IIIrd Vendeuvre,
the Xth Neufchâteau and Chaumont. The
important railway connections there and at Bologne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
were occupied, and the injury done to the line to
Blesme was repaired, so as to open up a new line of
communication. The health of the German forces had
been materially improved by short marches along
good roads and by abundant supplies; but a telegram
from Versailles now ordered an accelerated advance.</p>

<p>The Government in Paris being powerless, the Delegation
at Tours was displaying increased activity.
Gambetta, as Minister both of War and of the Interior,
was exercising the power almost of a Dictator, and the
fiery energy of this remarkable man had achieved the
feat of placing 600,000 armed men and 1400 guns in
the field in the course of a few weeks.</p>

<p>In the Arrondissements the National Guards were
formed into companies and battalions; then in each
Department these were consolidated into brigades; and
finally the brigades were incorporated along with the
nearest troops of the line and Gardes-Mobiles into the
larger Army-Corps.</p>

<p>Thus, in the course of October, under cover of the
troops of General d'Aurelle de Paladines which had
re-crossed the Loire, a new XVIIth Corps was made up
at Blois, another, the XVIIIth, at Gien, and a third,
under Admiral Jaurès, at Nogent le Rotrou. A large
force was in Picardy under General Bourbaki, another
at Rouen under Briand, and a third on the left bank of
the Seine under Fiéreck.</p>

<p>The detachments of the army investing Paris, which
were pushed forward to the south, west, and north,
already met in all directions strong forces of the enemy,
which they indeed repulsed in many small encounters,
but could not follow up to the places of their origin.
For such purposes the arrival of the army released from
the siege of Metz was needed, and this was not to be
looked for before some time in November, while now in
October there was threatened a general advance of the
French forces on Paris.</p>

<p>Having regard to the inferior strength of General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
von Tann's Division holding Orleans, at a French
council of war held at Tours it was decided to recover
that important place. The attack was to be delivered
chiefly from the west. The French XVth Corps&mdash;two
Infantry Divisions and one of Cavalry&mdash;therefore assembled
at Mer on the northern bank of the Lower Loire,
and the main body of the XVIth behind the forest of
Marchénoir. The remaining portions of both Corps
were to co-operate on the Upper Loire by way of Gien.
Any further advance was not projected, at any rate for
the present; on the contrary, General d'Aurelle's
instructions were to form an intrenched camp about
Orleans for 200,000 men.</p>

<p>General von Tann's reconnoitring parties to the westward
everywhere met hostile detachments, which were
indeed driven back by restraining skirmishes into the
forest of Marchénoir without much difficulty, but which
betrayed the vicinity of large forces of the enemy. On
the whole an attack from the south-west on the investing
army before Paris seemed the likeliest event, since
this would threaten both the German Head-quarter in
Versailles and the siege-park at Villacoublay; while the
German reinforcements from the eastward would have
the furthest distance to reach the quarter indicated.</p>

<p>The French forces to the west of Orleans were already
extended over a wide stretch of country from Beaugency
to Châteaudun. The volunteers grew bolder
every day, and the people more hostile.</p>

<p>At last, in quest of some more accurate information,
Count Stolberg (commanding 2nd Cavalry Division)
on November 7th made a reconnaissance in force.
Three regiments of the 2nd Cavalry Division, two
batteries, and some companies of Bavarian Infantry
advanced by Ouzouer and drove the enemy out of
Marolles, but they found the skirts of the forest strongly
held.</p>

<p>General Chanzy had brought up all his immediately
available troops to St. Laurent des Bois. A sharp fire-fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
ensued, lasting about half an hour, which caused
severe losses in the Bavarian infantry; and then, as
the great superiority of the French was evident, the
engagement was broken off.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, both the French Corps were
already in full march on Orleans. Reaching the forest
on the 8th, they occupied it firmly, their right wing at
Messas and Meung, their left at Ouzouer. The XVth
Corps was next to move to the right to the Mauve and
the XVIth to the left on Coulmiers. The heads of
those Corps showed themselves at Bardon and Charsonville
respectively. Both the French Cavalry Divisions
were directed northward on Prénouvellon to turn the
right wing of the Bavarians with a force of ten regiments,
six batteries, and numerous volunteer bands,
and thus to cut off their retreat on Paris.</p>

<p>To counteract this attempt the Bavarian Cuirassier
Brigade started for St. Péravy, the 2nd Cavalry Division
for Baccon, and, further south, the 2nd Bavarian
Infantry Division advancing from Orleans held the
country about Huisseau and St. Ay.</p>

<p>But an attack was also threatening the German rear
from the considerable force at Gien. General von der
Tann realized that it was now the last moment when
he could hope to extricate himself from so hazardous a
position; and that same evening he issued the necessary
orders. However desirable it was to keep possession
of Orleans, he could not accept battle in so thickly
wooded country, where the action of his relatively strong
artillery and cavalry would be seriously impeded, and
where indeed he might be entirely hemmed in. The
General, however, determined to strike at the most
immediately threatening hostile force in the open
country about Coulmiers, where he would at the same
time be nearer to the 22nd Division at Chartres, on
which he could call for support.</p>

<p>General von Wittich had already asked and obtained
permission to fall back on Orleans, but on the 9th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
he had only reached Voves, with his cavalry at Orgères;
thus he could not take any direct part in that
day's fighting.</p>

<p>The IInd Army was in full march from Metz, but on
this day its head had but just arrived at Troyes.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Engagement at Coulmiers.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(November 9th.)</div>


<p>Left thus to its own resources, the Ist Bavarian
Corps moved out in the night, and on the morning
of the 9th stood concentrated on the skirts of the forest
between Château Montpipeau and Rosières, with the
village of Coulmiers in its front. The Bavarian Cuirassiers
on the right wing protected the line of retreat
by St. Sigismond; the 2nd Cavalry Division was distributed
by brigades along the whole front, with detachments
well in advance and infantry posts ready in
support. Only a small detachment remained in Orleans
after the bridge over the Loiret had been destroyed,
to protect the numerous sick and wounded in
the field hospitals, and occupy the city at any rate till
the result of the fight was decided.</p>

<p>The first reports brought in that morning were of
the advance of a strong hostile column from Cravant
on Fontaines and Le Bardon. This was Rébillard's
Brigade, which, as it seemed, aimed at turning the
Bavarian left flank and marching direct on Orleans.
To oppose it on the bank of the Mauve, General von
der Tann at about nine o'clock sent the 3rd Brigade in
a southerly direction to Préfort, a little over two miles
distant, and as at the same time a sharp contest had
now begun at the outposts near Baccon, the 1st Brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
marched to La Renardière. The remainder of the
Corps remained in and behind Coulmiers. The General's
intention was to assume the offensive from this
point against the enemy's left flank, if, as seemed probable,
the latter should attempt to push his chief
attack across the Mauve. In furtherance of this intention
the cavalry of the right flank was ordered to close
in to Coulmiers.</p>

<p>But the superior strength of the French allowed of
their fetching a much wider compass to the left.
While General d'Aurelle with the XVth Corps detained
the Bavarians southward of the road from
Ouzouer to Orleans, General Chanzy advanced with
Barry's Division against their centre and directed
Jauréguiberry's Division northward against their right;
and finally the strong force of French cavalry under
General Reyau moved in the direction of Patay, thus
threatening the German communication with Paris.</p>

<p>This movement of the French XVIth Corps compelled
General von Tann, at the very beginning of the
engagement, to despatch the 2nd Brigade, which had
constituted his reserve, to prolong his right wing
northwards towards Champs, and thus obtain touch
with the 4th Cavalry Brigade. The Bavarian Cuirassiers,
retiring according to orders from St. Péravy to
the southward, about eleven o'clock encountered
Reyau's cavalry, which, however, restricted itself to a
mere cannonade.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after a stout resistance, the advanced
posts of the Bavarians had been driven in by the
enemy's superior strength. The 1st Rifle Battalion,
after having retarded the advance of the French horse-batteries
through Champdry for a long time, retreated
from Baccon to La Rivière,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> where it expected to be
received by the 2nd (Rifle Battalion). But the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of the latter soon became very critical. Peytavin's
Division closely followed up through Baccon, beset
La Rivière with five batteries, and then attacked the
burning village from three sides at once. After energetic
reprisals the Riflemen retired in good order on
the 1st Brigade in Renardière, where General Dietl
had taken up a position for defence.</p>

<p>After the evacuation of Baccon by the Bavarians,
Barry's Division had continued its advance through
Champdry, and its batteries deployed opposite Coulmiers
and in front of Saintry, in preparation for an
assault by strong lines of tirailleurs.</p>

<p>The 4th Bavarian Brigade occupied the park extending
to the west; the quarries further in front were
occupied by two battalions, two others were sent to the
right to the farmsteads of Ormeteau and Vaurichard,
so as to keep up some sort of communication with the
2nd Brigade. One battery to the south and four
batteries to the north of Coulmiers were supported by
the 5th Cavalry Brigade.</p>

<p>Thus at noon the Bavarian Corps, with only three
brigades, held the ground from Renardière to the
front of Gémigny, its front disproportionately extended
to a length of more than four miles. But the French
right wing remained quite inactive, so that the 3rd
Brigade which had been sent to Préfort was recalled
to Renardière.</p>

<p>When the French Corps had made good its foothold
opposite the thin Bavarian line, it attacked in earnest
at about one o'clock.</p>

<p>The Riflemen in Renardière had indeed repulsed the
enemy's first rush, but this position was no longer
tenable with only four battalions against the whole of
Peytavin's Division. At about one o'clock General
Dietl retired unmolested, under cover of an intermediate
position, on the wood of Montpipeau, and
occupied its border. Here he was joined by the 3rd
Brigade, which on its retirement from Préfort had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
found Renardière already evacuated. The French had
followed up from thence but hesitatingly, came under
the fire of six batteries between the points of the forests
at La Planche and Coulmiers, and made no further
advance with their right wing.</p>

<p>In the centre Barry's Division about one o'clock
had driven the Bavarian Riflemen out of the stone-quarries
in front of Coulmiers. Not till three o'clock
did it advance to a renewed general attack on the 4th
Brigade, which was repulsed by the fire of the German
guns and the repeated charges of the 5th Cavalry
Brigade.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, d'Aries' Brigade of the XVth French
Corps, after leaving Renardière, arrived southward of
Coulmiers, and its batteries strengthened the fire which
was being directed on that village. The Bavarian
guns were compelled before the rush of the French
tirailleurs to take ground further in rear, where
they resumed their activity, while the infantry
drove the French out of the park at the point of the
bayonet.</p>

<p>But after four hours' fighting the resistance of this
single brigade against three French brigades had become
extremely arduous. Of the whole Corps only
two battalions remained intact as a reserve at Bonneville,
no reinforcement was to be looked for from anywhere,
and on the right flank the French threatened
the communications with Chartres as well as with
Paris. At four in the afternoon General von der
Tann gave orders to break off the fight and to retire
by brigades from the left wing on Artenay.</p>

<p>Fresh troops of the enemy at this moment forced
their way into the park of Coulmiers. Colonel Count
von Ysenburg held the eastern outlets of the village,
and withdrew his troops by alternate echelons through
Gémigmy in good order.</p>

<p>It now proved of the greatest importance that the
2nd Brigade should have been able to maintain its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
position in front of this village, thus covering the
further retreat.</p>

<p>At noon, General von Orff (in command of the
Brigade), on approaching Champs and Cheminiers, had
found these villages occupied by Deplanque's French
Brigade. First he silenced its artillery, then he
deployed his four battalions for action, with the 4th
Cavalry Brigade on the right flank.</p>

<p>Reyau's Cavalry ere long came up between these
two villages, after it had given up its two hours'
cannonade against the Bavarian Cuirassiers and had
been driven out of St. Sigismond by dismounted
hussars. But this body of horse soon got out from
under the fire of the Bavarian guns and moved off to
the westward, it was said because it mistook Lipkowski's
volunteers, skirmishing further to the north, for
German reinforcements advancing. And when the
Bavarian horse-batteries opened fire on Champs from
the north-east, the French abandoned the place at
about two o'clock, in great disorder.</p>

<p>General von Orff now brought the artillery up to
within 500 paces of Cheminiers, and marched the
infantry up through the intervals.</p>

<p>Admiral Jauréguiberry, however, arriving in person,
succeeded in rallying the wavering troops, and this
attack failed. The French batteries soon compelled
the Bavarian horse-batteries to retire.</p>

<p>When, at about three o'clock, Bourdillon's Brigade
and the reserve artillery of the XVIth French Corps
also arrived at Champs, and news was brought of the
state of the fighting at Coulmiers, General von Orff
determined to refrain from all further attack, and confined
himself to maintaining his position in front of
Gémigny to the last extremity. Unshaken by the fire
of the numerous hostile batteries, the weak brigade
repulsed the repeated attacks of the enemy.</p>

<p>Thus the 4th Brigade was enabled unmolested to
retire from Coulmiers by Gémigny and St. Péravy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and the 1st, from Montpipeau further eastward, on
Coinces. The 2nd Brigade followed to Coinces, and
finally the 3rd formed the rear-guard as far as St.
Sigismond, where it halted and bivouacked. The
cavalry covered the retreat on all sides.</p>

<p>After a short rest the retreat of the main body was
continued during the night, by very bad roads. Artenay
was reached by the morning. Orleans was
evacuated, and the garrison which had been left there
rejoined its Corps. The stores were conveyed by railway
back to Toury; but one ammunition column, 150
prisoners, and the sick who could not be moved, fell
into the hands of the French.</p>

<p>This contest of 20,000 Germans against 70,000
French cost the former about 800 in killed and
wounded; the enemy's loss was nearly double.</p>

<p>From Artenay, on November 10th, the 2nd Brigade
undertook the duty of covering the further march on
Toury, where close quarters were available. Thither,
too, came the 22nd Division from Chartres, and took
up a position at Janville close to the Bavarians.
General von der Tann had extricated himself from a
difficult position with much skill and good fortune.
The enemy did not attempt a pursuit. General
d'Aurelle restricted himself to awaiting further reinforcements
in a strong position before Orleans. The
French preparations were, however, in greater activity
on the Upper Loir and the Eure.</p>

<p>On the German side the IInd Army Corps arrived
before Paris on the 5th of November; the 3rd Division
was included in the investing line between the Seine
and Marne; the 4th moved on to Longjumeau.</p>

<p>When the Guard Landwehr took possession of the
peninsula of Argenteuil, a brigade of the IVth Corps
became available for service on the north side of the
capital. On the south side, the 17th Division at Rambouillet,
the 22nd at Chartres, and the Bavarian Corps,
which had moved to Ablis, with the 4th and 6th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Cavalry Divisions, were ultimately formed into a separate
Army-Detachment of the IIIrd Army, under the
command of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg, and it
was ordered to betake itself in the first instance to
Dreux.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Operations of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg.</span></h2>


<p>On the 17th of November the 17th Division advanced
by Maintenon. On the left, a French detachment was
driven back across the Blaise; and when a few companies
of marines, who attempted to block the high-road,
had been disposed of, General von Tresckow
(commanding the Division) marched into Dreux that
evening. The combat had cost the Germans 50 men,
the French 150 and 50 prisoners.</p>

<p>Prince Frederick Charles, whose forces were now
at length assembled before Orleans in face of the
enemy, expressed the wish that the (Grand Duke's)
Detachment should advance on Tours by way of Le
Mans. The Grand Duke accordingly marched on
Nogent le Rotrou, which place, being the central
rendezvous of the French levies, promised to be the
scene of an obstinate resistance.</p>

<p>After several skirmishes the Detachment approached
the place, but when on the 22nd preparations were
being made to storm it from three sides, it was found
that the enemy had already evacuated it. At the
same time orders arrived from the supreme Headquarter,
instructing the Grand Duke to fall back at
once on Beaugency to join the right wing of the IInd
Army, which it was necessary should immediately be
reinforced in view of the superior strength of the
enemy. "The force now massing before Orleans is to
postpone all hostilities until the arrival of the Detachment.
The slight opposition offered by the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
on the Eure and Huisne sufficiently shows that no
serious danger threatens on that side; the enemy in
that quarter need only be kept under observation by
cavalry." The Detachment was not to be permitted
even a single rest day, and its march was to be
conducted with the utmost speed.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, the Divisions had closed up on their
respective heads, and the Grand Duke on the 24th
moved on Châteaudun and Vendôme; but the
Bavarian Corps only got as far as Vibraye, while the
two Prussian Divisions withdrew from the difficult
country of the Perche, and the cavalry found the whole
line of the Loir held by the enemy.</p>

<p>In fact, the French had sent a brigade of the troops
massed behind the forest of Marchénoir by railway to
Vendôme, expressly to protect the Government at
Tours, while General de Sonis had advanced with the
rest of the XVIIth Corps on Brou. Here on the 25th
his advance met an ammunition column and bridge-train
of the Bavarian Corps. At first only the 10th
Cavalry Brigade could engage the enemy, but when
presently two companies and eight guns had occupied
the bridge over the Loir at Yèvres, the waggons were
got through Brou in safety, and the enemy could not
enter that place till the cavalry had continued its
march.</p>

<p>The Bavarian Corps was meanwhile advancing on
Mondoubleau and St. Calais, not certainly the shortest
route to Beaugency, but, on the contrary, on the direct
road to Tours. The two Divisions only reached the
vicinity of Vibraye and Authon.</p>

<p>The appearance of a hostile force at Brou was
deemed of sufficient importance to justify a détour by
that place, postponing for the moment the prescribed
march on the Loire. But when the 22nd Division
approached Brou on the 26th, it found that the enemy
had already retired during the night. The Government
at Tours had ordered the whole of the XVIIth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Corps to concentrate at Vendôme for their protection.
But when the German cavalry made its appearance
at Cloyes and Fréteval, General Sonis considered that
he could not pursue his march further along the Loir,
and made a détour by Marchénoir. But two night-marches
so shattered the levies for the first time
collected in mass that whole swarms of stragglers
wandered about the neighbourhood all day and could
only with difficulty be re-assembled at Beaugency.</p>

<p>To imbue the operations with unity of command, the
Grand Duke was now, by instruction from the supreme
Head-quarter, placed under Prince Frederick Charles's
orders, and General von Stosch<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> was despatched to
undertake the duties of Chief of the Staff to the
Detachment. That force by the Prince's orders was
to come in with all speed to Janville, whither troops of
the IXth Corps would be sent to meet it by way of
Orgères.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke therefore marched, on the 27th,
with both his (Prussian) Divisions (17th and 22nd) to
Bonneval, where there was already a squadron of the
2nd Cavalry Division. The Bavarian Corps, which,
after finding Brou abandoned, had been directed on
Courtalin, marched to Châteaudun. Having thus
accomplished a junction with the IInd Army, the sorely
fatigued troops of the Detachment were allowed a day's
rest on the 28th, in quarters on the Loir.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Situation of IInd Army.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(Second half of November.)</div>


<p>Prince Frederick Charles had hastened the advance
of his army as much as possible, but it had met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
with many hindrances. The roads were broken up,
National Guards and franctireurs stood watchful for
mischief, and even the country people had taken
up arms. However, by November 14th the IXth
Corps with the 1st Cavalry Division reached Fontainebleau,
whence it pursued its march to Angerville.
The IIIrd Corps was following on Pithiviers. Of the
Xth Corps the 40th Brigade was left at Chaumont, to
make connection with the XIVth Corps; the 36th
reached Montargis and Beaune la Rolande on the 21st.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
The two brigades following in rear (37th and 39th)
had a sharp encounter on the 24th at Ladon and
Maizières. In this combat 170 French prisoners
were taken, who belonged to a corps which, as General
von Werder had already reported, was proceeding
under General Crouzat's command from Chagny to
Gien by railway. The order of battle was found on an
officer who was among the prisoners.</p>

<p>That while the Grand Duke's Detachment was
marching to join it, the IInd Army, only now fully
concentrated, was in very close proximity to considerable
forces of the enemy, was ascertained beyond doubt
by several reconnoissances.</p>

<p>On the 24th troops of the IXth Corps advanced
along the great high-road. A few shells caused the
enemy to evacuate Artenay, pursued by the cavalry as
far as Croix Briquet. Early in the same day a mixed
detachment of all arms from the IIIrd Corps reached
Neuville aux Bois. Two detachments of the 38th
Brigade marched on Bois Commun and Bellegarde,
but everywhere those inquisitive reconnaissances were
met by very superior numbers of the enemy.</p>

<p>It was ascertained that the position of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
before Orleans extended for about 37 miles from the
Conie to Loing; and the massing of troops, especially
on their (right) flank, made it highly probable that
they proposed advancing by Fontainebleau on the rear
of the besieging army. Still, this intention was not
so evident as to justify Prince Frederick Charles in
leaving the great highways from Orleans to Paris unguarded.
However, to enable him to lend his left wing
timely support in case of need, he moved the 5th
Infantry Division of the IIIrd Corps and the 1st
Cavalry Division to Boynes, nearer to the Xth Corps
which was weak, and the 6th Division occupied
Pithiviers in their stead. The quarters at Bazoches
vacated by the 6th Division, were assigned to the IXth
Corps. Finally, the Grand Duke received orders to
reach Toury with his heads of columns by the 29th at
latest. These dispositions were all carried out in due
course.</p>

<p>Immediately after its success at Coulmiers the French
Army of the Loire seemed for the moment only to have
thought of securing itself against a counter-blow. It
retired on Orleans, threw up extensive entrenchments,
for which marine artillery was even brought up from
Cherbourg, and awaited the arrival of further reinforcements.
The XXth Corps, already mentioned,
40,000 strong, joined the XVth, XVIth, and XVIIth
at Gien, in addition to one Division of the XVIIIth
newly assembled at Nevers, and finally the volunteer
bands under Cathelineau and Lipowski.</p>

<p>Thus the French Army round Orleans numbered
200,000; the German infantry opposed to this host for
the time reached a strength of not more than 45,000
men.</p>

<p>Gambetta soon became urgent for renewed offensive
operations. As General d'Aurelle raised objections to
an advance by Pithiviers and Malesherbes, the Dictator
himself took in hand the dispositions. In the night of
the 22nd&mdash;23rd he telegraphed orders from Tours that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the XVth Corps was at once to assemble at Chilleurs
aux Bois and reach Pithiviers on the 24th; the
XXth to march to Beaune la Rolande; and that then
both Corps were to advance by way of Fontainebleau
on Paris. The General pointed out that, according
to his reckoning, 80,000 Germans must be encountered
in an open country, and that it would be
more advisable to await their attack in an intrenched
position. Further, that this movement could be of no
service in affording succour to the distressed capital,
and that meanwhile there would remain unperformed
the strengthening of the right wing, where on the 24th
the unsteadiness of the XVIIIth and XXth Corps had
caused the loss of the already mentioned fight at Ladon
and Maizières.</p>

<p>In accordance with instructions received from Tours
on the 26th, General Crouzat ordered the advance for
the 28th of the two Corps he commanded&mdash;the XVIIIth
by the right through Juranville, the XXth by the left
through Bois Commun&mdash;for an encompassing attack on
Beaune la Rolande. The XVth Corps in addition was
moved up to Chambon in support, and Cathelineau's
volunteers went forward to Courcelles.</p>

<p>As we have seen, on this same day the Grand Duke's
Detachment had come up on the extreme right of the
IInd German Army. On the left stood the Xth Corps
with the 38th Brigade at Beaune, the 39th at Les
Côtelles; the 37th, with the Corps artillery, had
advanced to Marcilly between these two places.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> There seems some confusion here. The 36th Brigade belonged,
not to the Xth, but to the IXth Corps. The 38th Brigade is stated

rest of the Corps (exclusive of the 40th Brigade) still behind at
Montargis.</p></div>
</div>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Beaune la Rolande.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(November 28th.)</div>


<p>The French attack on November 28th failed because
of the miscarriage of the projected combination, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
two separate attempts exerting little reciprocal influence.
On the right, the head of the XVIIIth Corps struck
the outposts of the 39th Brigade at an early hour, in
front of Juranville and Lorcy. Not until after a stout
resistance were these driven in by about nine o'clock
on Les Côtelles and behind the railway-embankment
at Corbeilles, where they took possession of the park.</p>

<p>The French could now deploy in the open country
in front of Juranville, and following up with strong
lines of tirailleurs preceding them, they forced their
way into Corbeilles and drove the garrison out to the
north and west. But meanwhile, on the other side, a
reinforcement from the reserve at Marcilly reached Les
Côtelles, and now Colonel von Valentini passed to
the attack of Juranville with the 56th Regiment. The
artillery could afford no co-operation, the enemy made
an obstinate resistance, and not till noon did he begin
to retreat, while bitter fighting still continued round
some detached houses. But when strong columns
came up from Maizières and Corbeilles, the Germans
were compelled to abandon the conquered village,
carrying off with them 300 prisoners.</p>

<p>About two o'clock the greater portion of the French
Corps deployed near Juranville for an attack on the
position at Long Cour, into which the 39th Brigade
had retired. But since the attack had not been prepared
by artillery, it came to nothing under the fire of
five Prussian batteries.</p>

<p>The first attack on Les Côtelles was also repulsed,
but when it was repeated an hour later, the Germans had
to abandon the place with the loss of fifty men taken
prisoners. A gun, seven of the gunners of which had
fallen, sank so deep in the soft ground that the few
men left could not drag it out.</p>

<p>The XVIIIth French Corps, however, made no
further way, but, as dusk came on, contented itself with
an ineffective cannonade, and finally the 39th Brigade
was able to maintain its position abreast of Beaune.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>On the left wing of the French line of battle the
attack had also from the first been of an encompassing
tendency, the 2nd Division of the XXth Corps having
advanced on Beaune, and the 1st on Batilly. But it
was near noon before the arrival of part of its 3rd
Division, which had remained in reserve, enabled the
enemy to drive in the German advanced posts from
Bois de la Leu to the cross-roads north-west of Beaune.
And here also the 38th Brigade soon found itself under
the artillery and infantry fire from Pierre Percée, the
enemy continually gaining ground from the northward.
The retreat had to be continued along the Cæsar
road, whereon a gun, of which the men and horses had
for the most part perished, fell into the enemy's hands.
About the same time the 2nd French Division ascended
the heights to the east of Beaune, and Colonel von
Cranach was first enabled to rally the 57th Regiment
further rearward, near La Rue Boussier, whereby the
withdrawal of the batteries hurrying away from Marcilly
was covered, and the further advance of the enemy was
then arrested. Any such effort on his part entirely
ceased when he was suddenly threatened on his own flank
by the 1st Prussian Cavalry Division advancing from
Boynes, and came under fire of its horse-batteries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 16th Regiment found itself completely
isolated in Beaune, and surrounded on three sides by
the enemy.</p>

<p>The town, which was surrounded by the remains of
a high wall, and the churchyard were as far as possible
prepared for defence. The enemy, after his first onset
by strong swarms of riflemen had been driven back,
set about bombarding the town. His shells burst
through the walls of the churchyard and set a few
buildings on fire, but every attempt at an assault was
steadfastly repulsed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, General von Woyna had replenished
the ammunition of his batteries, and while occupying
Romainville on the right, he also took up a position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
opposite the copses of Pierre Percée, so that by three
o'clock he was able to bring up seven companies on the
east side of Beaune.</p>

<p>About this time assistance came with the arrival
of the IIIrd Army Corps. While the 6th Division was
still pressing on towards Pithiviers, the 5th had already
that morning stood to arms in front of that place.
The first news from Beaune had sounded so far from
alarming, that the Corps-artillery retired to its quarters.
Nevertheless, in consequence of the increasing cannon
thunder and later information of a serious encounter,
General von Alvensleben gave the word for the Corps
to advance, with the 5th Division of which General
von Stülpnagel had already set out of his own initiative.
The 6th followed, and detached a battalion to observe
towards Courcelles; wherein, however, Cathelineau's
volunteers remained inactive.</p>

<p>Part of the 52nd Regiment, which was marching at
the head of the column, turned off to the right, and,
supported by artillery, began a fire-fight about 4.30
against Arconville and Batilly. Another part penetrated
into the Bois de la Leu and the copses near La
Pierre Percée, where it recaptured the gun which had
been lost there earlier. Four batteries in position on
the road from Pithiviers, behind Fosse des Prés,
directed their fire on the enemy still holding his ground
on the west side of Beaune, from which he was finally
driven by the 12th Regiment, and pursued as far as
Mont Barrois.</p>

<p>After dark the Xth Corps encamped about Long Cour,
Beaune and Batilly, and the 5th Division in its rear;
the 6th remained at Boynes, where the 1st Division of
Cavalry also found accommodation.</p>

<p>In the battle of Beaune la Rolande General von
Voigts-Rhetz had to hold his ground against the enemy
with 11,000 men against 60,000, with three brigades
against six Divisions, until help reached him towards
evening. This action cost the Germans 900 and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
French 1300 men in killed and wounded; and 1800
unwounded prisoners fell into the hands of the
Germans.</p>

<p>In the evening the French XXth Corps had retreated
as far as Bois Commun and Bellegarde; the XVIIIth,
on the contrary, had taken up its position near Vernouille
and Juranville, in fact, directly in front of the
Xth German Corps, on the ground which the former
had won. The expectation was therefore not unnatural
that the fighting would recommence on the morrow.</p>

<p>Prince Frederick Charles, therefore, directed the Xth
and IIIrd Corps to assemble on the 29th in full preparedness.
The IXth received orders to advance with
two brigades towards Boynes and Bazoches, and the
remaining troops were to follow as soon as the Grand
Duke's Detachment should have reached the main road
to Paris. Of it in the course of the day the heads
arrived, the 4th Cavalry Division at Toury, the infantry
at Allaines and Orgères. The 6th Cavalry Division,
which was marching on the right flank, met first with
opposition at Tournoisis.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General Crouzat had been instructed from
Tours by a message which reached him on the evening
of the 28th, to desist for the present from further
offensive attack, and the French right wing was thereupon
drawn further back. On the 30th both Corps
moved leftward, in order to be again nearer to the
XVth. For the purpose of disguising this lateral
movement, detachments were sent in a northerly
direction and met reconnoitring parties of the German
Xth and IIIrd Corps, with which skirmishes took
place at Maizières, St. Loup and Mont Barrois; and
the movement of the French was soon detected, in the
first instance on their left flank.</p>

<p>The Government at Tours had received news from
Paris that General Ducrot would attempt on the
29th to break through the German investing lines with
100,000 men and 400 guns, and endeavour to connect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
with the Army of the Loire in a southerly direction.
The balloon which carried this despatch had descended
in Norway, whence the message had been forwarded.
It was concluded from this that the General was already
vigorously engaged, and that help must be no longer
delayed. Commissioned by Gambetta, M. Freycinet
submitted to a council of war called by General
d'Aurelle, a scheme for the advance of the whole army
on Pithiviers. In the event of a refusal by the Commander-in-Chief
to accept the same, M. Freycinet carried
an order for his supersession.</p>

<p>It was decided in the first place to execute a wheel
to the right with the left wing, Chilleurs aux Bois
forming the pivot of the movement. While a front was
thus being formed against Pithiviers, the Corps of
the right wing on a parallel front were to await the
order to move until this was accomplished. The
XXIst Corps was to be sent to Vendôme to cover the
left flank.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">The Advance of the Army of the Loire to the
Relief of Paris.</span></h2>


<p>As the result of those dispositions, on the 1st of
December the XVIth Corps moved on Orgères, in the
direction of the railway; the XVIIth followed to Patay
and St. Péravy.</p>

<p>Opposite to these forces, on the right wing of the
IInd German Army the 17th Division of the Grand
Duke's Detachment had arrived at Bazoches, the 22nd
at Toury, and the Bavarian Corps reached the vicinity
of Orgères. Thus the hostile shock fell first on the
last body. Attacked in front by a far superior force,
and threatened in flank by Michel's Cavalry Division,
the 1st Bavarian Brigade was forced to retreat at three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
o'clock to Villepion. The 2nd Brigade approaching
from Orgères, halted to the west of Nonneville, and the
4th marched up to between Villepion and Faverolles,
which position the Bavarians, in spite of heavy losses,
succeeded in holding for a long time. On their right
wing Prince Leopold of Bavaria, with the four guns
of his battery still serviceable, arrested the enemy's
advance on Nonneville, but under the personal leadership
of Admiral Jauréguiberry the French forced their
way into Villepion. As night drew on, and the want
of ammunition was becoming serious, the 1st Bavarian
Brigade went to Loigny; the 2nd, however, did not retreat
until five o'clock to Orgères, where also the 3rd
arrived in the evening, whilst the 4th joined the 1st
at Loigny.</p>

<p>The engagement cost both sides about 1000 men, and
only the foremost Bavarian detachments were forced
back for a short distance.</p>

<p>This measure of success, and the news from Paris, rekindled
in Tours ardent hopes of victory. As will be
seen further on, a sortie from Paris on 30th November
had certainly so far succeeded that the village of Epinay
on the northern section of the line of investment
was occupied for a short time. Thereupon it was
summarily concluded that this was the village of the
same name which lay to the south near Longjumeau,
and that there was now scarcely any obstacle to the
junction of the Army of Orleans with that of Paris.
Cathelineau's volunteer Corps was directed at once
to occupy the forest of Fontainebleau, and the imminent
annihilation of the Germans was announced to the
country.</p>

<p>The head of the Army of Orleans, nevertheless, had
barely made half a day's march in the direction of Paris,
and the right wheel of the left wing remained to be accomplished.
The XVIth Corps was to attempt to reach
the line Allaines-Toury by the 2nd of December; the
XVIIth was to follow, and the XVth, marching from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Chilleurs through Artenay, was to close to the right.
The Grand Duke, on the report of the great force in
which the enemy was approaching, determined to
march to meet him with the whole strength of the
Detachment. The requisite orders were issued at eight
o'clock in the morning to the Divisions, which were
already standing prepared on their respective assembling-grounds.
The Bavarian Corps was directed to
take up a position opposite Loigny with its left wing
at Château-Goury; the 17th Division to march immediately
from Santilly to Lumeau, and the 22nd from
Tivernon to Baigneaux. The cavalry was to undertake
the protection of both wings.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Loigny&mdash;Poupry.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(December 2nd.)</div>


<p>The Bavarian Corps was still engaged in the advance
from Maladerie when the French ascended the heights
to the west of Loigny. The 1st Division, therefore,
marched towards Villeprévost, and the 2nd held the
line Beauvilliers-Goury.</p>

<p>At 8 a.m. General Chanzy set out with his 2nd
and 3rd Divisions from Terminiers, for Loigny and
Lumeau. The 1st followed in reserve, and Michel's
Cavalry Division covered the left flank. In spite of
the strong fire of the defenders, the 2nd Division by
nine o'clock advanced close upon Beauvilliers, but then
it had to give way before the onset of the Bavarians,
who now on their side attacked Loigny. When,
however, at 10.30 the whole French Corps advanced,
deployed on a broad front from Nonneville to Neuvilliers,
they had to fall back with great losses. They,
however, found a rallying point at Beauvilliers, where
the fire of the Corps artillery gave pause to the
advance of the enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The combat surged backwards and forwards until, at
11.30, the 2nd Bavarian Brigade joined in the fray.
The 4th Cavalry Division charged the left flank of the
enemy; and Michel's Division fell back on the XVIIth
Corps, numerous prisoners thus falling into the hands
of the German troopers. In the meantime the Bavarian
infantry had marched to Ferme Morâle with intent to
renew the attack, but there found itself under fire so
destructive that it was forced to turn back. Thereupon
the horse-batteries on the flank enfiladed the enemy's
wing with such effect, that the farm was set on fire and
General von Orff found himself able to take possession
of it.</p>

<p>At Beauvilliers, meanwhile, the 2nd Division had
only with great difficulty resisted the vigorous onslaughts
of the French, whose rifle-swarms were already
so close that the batteries were compelled to retire
to positions further back. But the success of the right
wing soon extended to the left. Breaking out from Beauvilliers,
as well as from Château Goury, the Bavarians
drove Jauréguiberry's Division back to Loigny.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon the firing of the French became
again remarkably energetic, especially against Château
Goury. The battalions of the Bavarian left wing were
forced back upon the park.</p>

<p>During these events the two Prussian Divisions had
continued their advance. The artillery of the 17th
pressed on in order to engage the enemy, while the
head of the infantry reached Lumeau in time to prevent
its occupation by the opposing forces. Strong swarms
of French riflemen fought their way up quite close to
the place, but they were finally driven back by
a well-directed fire of musketry and shell; whereupon
the Division assailed the right flank of the French
attack.</p>

<p>The 22nd Division also marched through Baigneaux
to Anneux, and joined in the pursuit of the retreating
enemy. A number of prisoners and a battery
were captured, and the enemy, after a vain attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
make another stand near Neuvilliers, at last fled towards
Terminiers in utter disorder.</p>

<p>After this result of the fighting about Lumeau,
General von Tresckow was able to go to the assistance
of the hard-pressed left wing of the Bavarians. Under
cover of the fire of eight batteries the 33rd Brigade
moved against the flank of the French masses which
were now making a fierce attack on Château Goury.
Taken by surprise, these retired upon Loigny. But
there, too, the Mecklenburg battalions forced in,
shoulder to shoulder with the Bavarians, and it was
only in the churchyard on high ground at the west
end of the village, that an obstinate resistance was
made for some time longer. The French, as they
retired on Villepion, suffered from a destructive fire
from eighty guns massed near Loigny.</p>

<p>At 2.30 General von der Tann caused the whole of
his 1st Division, after the replenishment of its ammunition,
to advance once more; this movement, however,
was arrested by the fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>Michel's Division moved up to oppose the advance of
the German cavalry on the right flank, but went about
as soon as it came within range of the horse-batteries.</p>

<p>Because of the exposed condition of his right flank,
General Chanzy had sent a few battalions to form a
refused flank<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> near Terre-noire. Behind this a brigade
of the XVIIth Corps came up near Faverolles, and to
the right of Villepion the Papal Zouaves advanced
against Villours.</p>

<p>General von Tresckow now threw in his last reserves.
Two battalions of the 75th Regiment broke
into the place at the first charge, and in conjunction
with all the troops fighting in the vicinity, drove back
the French columns to Villepion.</p>

<p>The approach of darkness brought the fighting here
to a close.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>While the French XVIth Corps had been fighting
single-handed with great persistence all day, the XVth,
according to orders, had advanced through Artenay
along the Paris high-road. There it was opposed only
by the 3rd Cavalry Brigade. That force was attacked
about mid-day near Dambron by the 3rd French
Division, which formed the left-flank column, while the
other two Divisions held much further to the right.</p>

<p>So soon as this information came in from the cavalry,
General von Wittich moved off with the whole of the
22nd Division from Anneux in the direction of Poupry.
The head of the column reached that place at the
double, and succeeded in driving back the enemy, who
had already broken in there and occupied the forest
belts to the north. Six batteries then came into action,
resting on Morâle to the south. The French deployed
between Dambron and Autroches, and maintained a
persistent fire while their remaining Divisions came up.
After an encounter with the troops from Poupry, they
occupied with their right wing the small copses which
lay near, in front of the forest-land to the north, placed
the artillery in the intervals, and began at three o'clock
an attack from thence. This, however, withered under
a fire of grape-shot from the defenders, and the menace
of a charge by the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, which General
von Colomb had set in motion in the open country to
the west of Dambron. An attack on Morâle by the
left wing from Autroches likewise miscarried. But at
four o'clock the French advanced along their whole
front, preceded by great swarms of tirailleurs. They
were repulsed at Poupry, and likewise at Morâle, at
which latter place two companies of pioneers joined in
the fight; on the other hand, their right wing pushed
into the forest, and compelled its defenders to retreat.
But Prussian battalions yet remaining in reserve,
advanced from Poupry, and drove the enemy back into
the copses, where he had still to defend himself against
an attack by the cavalry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>The fighting was now stopped by the approach of
night. The 22nd Division remained under arms till
eleven o'clock in the position which it had seized, and
only then withdrew to Anneux. The 3rd Cavalry
Division quartered for the night in Baigneaux. The
17th Division remained in position near Lumeau, having
Loigny in its front, which it occupied in concert with
the Bavarians, who extended further to the right as
far as Orgères.</p>

<p>The day had cost the French 4000 killed and wounded,
and the Germans fully as many, but 2500 unwounded
prisoners, eight guns, one mitrailleuse and a standard belonging
to the enemy were left in possession of the latter.</p>

<p>On the French side, the XVth Corps retired to
Artenay and received orders, under cover of a Division
to be left there, to occupy the defensive position previously
held on the skirt of the forest.</p>

<p>Thus the intended further advance of the left wing
of the Army of Orleans had not succeeded. The XVIth
Corps, lacking the support of the XVIIth, had indeed
lost ground, but still maintained itself with its most
advanced line on Villepion, Faverolles and Terminiers.
General Chanzy therefore considered himself justified
in making yet another effort against the German right
wing on the following day.</p>

<p>The German strength consisted of five Corps, and
stood close in front of the enemy; further reinforcements
could not be immediately expected, but by the
supreme Command it was judged that the moment had
now come to put an end to the standing menace from
the south against the investment of Paris.</p>

<p>At mid-day of the 2nd, the order came from the Royal
Head-quarter to undertake an attack on Orleans in full
strength, and in the course of that day Prince Frederick
Charles gave the requisite instructions to this end.</p>

<p>It is here necessary to go back a little in order to see
how circumstances developed events during November
at various other points.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Paris in November.</span></h2>


<p>The tidings, which became known on the 14th November,
of the happy result of the action at Coulmiers on
the 9th, had rekindled in Paris universal hope. No one
doubted that the enemy would find it necessary to send
large forces in the Orleans direction, which would considerably
weaken the investment line, particularly in
its southern section.</p>

<p>In order to contribute towards the hoped-for approaching
relief by active co-operation, three separate
armies were formed out of the garrison of Paris.</p>

<p>The first, under General Clément Thomas, consisted
of 226 battalions of the National Guard, in round
numbers 130,000 men. Its duty was the defence of the
enceinte and the maintenance of quietude within the
city. The second, under General Ducrot, constituted the
most trustworthy element, especially the troops of the
former XIIIth and XIVth Corps. This army was
apportioned into three (Infantry) Corps and one Cavalry
Division, and it consisted of fully 100,000 men and
more than 300 guns. It was designed for active service
in the field, and for making sorties on the investing
forces. The third army, under General Vinoy,
70,000 strong, was made up of six Divisions of Gardes-Mobiles
and one Cavalry Division; and to it also
Maud'huy's Division of the line was assigned. It was
to aid the more important sorties by diversions on subordinate
fronts. In addition to all these details, 80,000
Gardes-Mobiles were in the forts, and 35,000 more in
St. Denis under Admiral de la Roncière.</p>

<p>The available military strength consequently amounted
to above 400,000 men.</p>

<p>The garrison exhibited a lively activity in petty
nocturnal enterprises. The heavy guns of the defences
carried to Choisy le Roi, and even as far as Beauregard,
near Versailles. On the peninsula of Gennevilliers
trenchwork was energetically set about, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
task of bridge-building was undertaken. Many signs
pointed to an intended effort on the part of the French
to break out in a westerly direction. But since, as
long as the IInd Army was still incomplete, the
greatest danger threatened from the south, the supreme
Command in Versailles, as already mentioned, ordered
the IInd Corps into the position behind the Yvette
from Villeneuve to Saclay. On the north of Paris the
Guard Corps extended itself leftward as far as Aulnay,
the XIIth sent one brigade across to the south bank of
the Marne, and the Würtemberg Division moved into
the interval between the Marne and the Seine caused by
the shifting of the IInd Corps.</p>

<p>On November 18th the summons from Tours reached
Paris, calling on the latter with all promptitude to
reach the hand to the Army of the Loire; certainly
somewhat prematurely, since, as we know, that army
was at the time concerning itself only in regard to
defensive measures.</p>

<p>In Paris all preparations were actually made for a
great sortie. But as the earlier attacks on the front of
the VIth Corps had shown that this section of the investment
was materially strengthened by fortifications
about Thiais and Chevilly, it was decided in the first
instance to gain the plateau east of Joinville and from
thence to bend rightward towards the south. The attention
of the Germans was to be distracted by attacks in
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>On the 18th,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the day on which the Army of Orleans
had vainly striven to press forward to Beaune la Rolande,
General Ducrot assembled the IInd Army of
Paris in the neighbourhood of Vincennes, and Mont
Avron was occupied on the following day by Hugues'
Division of the IIIrd Army. As, however, the construction
of the bridges (over the Marne) at Champigny
and Bry was delayed, the battle was postponed
till the 30th; but it was left to the commanders of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
subordinate affairs to carry them out simultaneously
with the chief enterprise or in advance of it. Accordingly,
Maud'huy's Division assembled in the night of
28th&mdash;29th behind the redoubt of Hautes Bruyères,
and advanced against L'Hay before daybreak.</p>

<p>Warned by the heavy firing from the southern forts,
General von Tümpling (commanding VIth Corps) had
early ordered the 12th Division to get under arms in its
fighting positions, and the 11th to assemble at Fresnes.</p>

<p>The French, favoured by the darkness, made their
way through the vineyards into L'Hay; but were successfully
driven back by the Germans with the bayonet
and clubbed arms.</p>

<p>After a prolonged fire-fight, the French renewed
their onslaught at 8.30, but without success; and then
the defenders, reinforced from the reserve, retaliated
with a vigorous counterstroke. At ten o'clock the
enemy retreated to Villejuif.</p>

<p>Admiral Pothuau at the same time had moved up the
Seine with Marines and National Guards. An outpost
at Gare aux B&oelig;ufs was surprised and captured, and
Choisy le Roi was fired upon by field-guns, fortress
artillery, and gunboats which appeared on the Seine.
Just as the Grenadiers of the 10th (Prussian) Regiment
were on the point of making an attack, General
Vinoy broke off the fight.</p>

<p>This demonstration cost the French 1000 men and
300 uninjured prisoners; the Prussians, remaining
under cover, lost only 140 men. The fortress kept up
its fire till mid-day, and then the enemy was allowed a
short truce, to remove his numerous wounded.</p>

<p>Against the front of the Vth Corps also, a strong
infantry force advanced at eight o'clock upon Garches
and Malmaison, and drove in part of the outposts. But
it soon found itself opposed by closed battalions, and at
noon retreated to Valérien.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Attempt of the Army of Paris to break
out.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(November 30th and December 2nd.)</div>


<p>On November 30th the IInd Paris Army opened
the battle which was to decide the fate of the capital.</p>

<p>To hinder the reinforcement of the Germans towards
the real point of attack, almost every section of their
line of investment was again engrossed by sorties.</p>

<p>To the duty of pushing an attack against the southern
front, General Ducrot assigned Susbielle's Division of
his IInd Corps. It reached Rosny so early as three
o'clock in the morning, crossed the Marne at Créteil by
a field-bridge, and from thence, briskly supported by
the nearest forts, opened fire on the outpost line of the
Würtemberg Division, which had been pushed forward
to Bonneuil and Mesly.</p>

<p>General von Obernitz (commanding the Division) had
an extended position to maintain. His 1st Brigade was
at Villiers on the peninsula of Joinville, his 2nd at
Sucy en Brie, and his 3rd at Brévannes. The Division
was placed under the Commander of the Army of the
Meuse, who had been instructed from Versailles to reinforce
it strongly by the XIIth Corps, or even by
troops of the Guard Corps.</p>

<p>From the great accumulation of hostile forces on
Mont Avron, the Saxon Corps believed itself directly
threatened on the right bank of the Marne, and requested
to be immediately transferred to the left; the
Crown Prince of Saxony gave the order that the whole
24th Division should assemble there on the following day.</p>

<p>Thus for the present the only aid that could be rendered
to the Würtembergers was from the wing of the
IInd Corps at Villeneuve, of which the 7th Infantry
Brigade moved up near Brévannes to Valenton.</p>

<p>The fire of its three batteries hurrying thither, first
brought the advance of the French Division to a stand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
The attempt of the Würtembergers to seize Mont-Mesly
failed at first; but after a strenuous artillery fire they
succeeded in carrying the hill by twelve o'clock, and
the Prussian battalions forced their way into Mesly.
The Würtemberg horse cut in upon the enemy's retreating
guns with great success. At 1.30 the re-opening
of the fire from the forts proclaimed the end of
this sortie. It cost the Germans 350 men, and the
French 1200.</p>

<p>During this time the front of the VIth Corps had not
been at all molested. General Vinoy, who had not
been informed of the advance of Susbielle's Division,
when its retreat was noticed caused to be opened from
Fort Ivry and the adjoining works a brisk fire, which
was augmented by gunboats on the Seine and armour-plated
batteries on the railway. Then Admiral
Pothuau advanced against Choisy le Roi and Thiais.
His Marines, after driving out the Prussian fore-posts,
again settled themselves firmly in Gare aux
B&oelig;ufs. But the further advance failed, and General
Vinoy recalled his troops, after which the fighting
at Mesly ceased, and only the thunder of artillery
continued till five o'clock.</p>

<p>After a preliminary cannonade from Valérien the
Gardes-Mobiles advanced against the front of the Vth
Corps about seven o'clock. They were, however, repulsed
by the outposts and supporting troops in readiness,
and retired at eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>On the northern front of Paris there occurred also
a sharp fight. At mid-day Fort de la Briche, supported
by field-guns and a floating battery, opened a
heavy fire on the low-lying village of Epinay on the
right bank of the Seine. At two o'clock Haurion's
Brigade advanced, two companies of marines pressed
into the place along the bank of the river, and drove
out the garrison, which consisted of only one company.
A second also retired from the defence-works in a
northerly direction towards Ormesson. At three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
o'clock in the afternoon, the village, up to some still
obstinately defended farms on the further side of the
mill-race, fell into the hands of the French.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the troops of the IVth Corps had assembled,
and seven batteries came into action on the overhanging
heights. The infantry rushed upon the village
from all sides with loud cheers, and about four o'clock,
after a fierce street-fight, recovered possession of the
posts which had been lost; and it was this transitory
conquest that was to raise so great hopes in Tours.
The losses on both sides amounted to 300 men.</p>

<p>Those affairs were all mere feints to facilitate the chief
action; and whilst the investing troops were thus
engaged and held fast at all points, two Corps of the
IInd French Army at 6.30 in the morning crossed the
bridges at Joinville and Nogent which had been completed
during the night. After repulsing the German
outposts they both deployed, and stretched completely
across the peninsula between Champigny and Bry.
The IIIrd Corps had taken the road along the north
bank of the Marne, towards Neuilly, to cross the river
there, thus threatening to compromise the position
of the Saxon Corps, which therefore still detained the
47th Brigade on the right bank, though it had been
assigned to the assistance of the Würtembergers.
Consequently there were available to oppose the two
French Corps on the left bank, only two German
brigades extended over about four miles, the Saxon
48th about Noisy, and the Würtemberg 1st from
Villiers to Chennevières.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock Maussion's Division advanced against
the Park of Villiers. Supported by Saxon detachments
from Noisy, the Würtembergers repulsed a first attack,
but in following it up met with heavy losses. The
French batteries of two Divisions and those of the
Artillery Reserve formed line in front of the park.
On their right Faron's Division, not without heavy
losses, succeeded in gaining possession of Champigny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and had then established itself in front of that village
to defend the occupation of it.</p>

<p>General Ducrot's original idea had been to maintain
a stationary fight on the peninsula until he should be
joined at Noisy by his IIIrd Corps. But as news
arrived that at eleven o'clock it was still on the
northern side of the Marne, he ordered an immediate
general attack by both his other Corps.</p>

<p>On the left the advance was checked for a considerable
time by the German batteries which had been
pushed forward between Noisy and Villiers, and when
Colonel von Abendroth moved out from both villages
with six companies of the 48th Brigade to an attack in
close formation, the French fell back into the vineyards
on the western slope of the plateau, leaving
behind two guns, which, however, the Saxons could
not carry away for want of teams.</p>

<p>In the centre of the line of fight, Berthaut's Division
tried to push forward south of Villiers, but by the fire
of five batteries in position there and at Coeuilly its
ranks were so severely thinned that it gave ground
before the advance of a Saxon battalion.</p>

<p>On the right wing, the guns which had been brought
up into position in front of Champigny had at last been
compelled by the German artillery to withdraw, and
had sought cover further north, near the lime-kilns. A
body of French infantry had advanced along the riverside
to Maison Blanche, but meanwhile the 2nd Würtemberg
Brigade, although itself attacked at Sucy, despatched
a reinforcement of two companies and a battery
to Chennevières. Advancing from the Hunting-lodge,
the Würtembergers took 200 French prisoners at
Maison Blanche; though, on the other hand, an attempt
to carry the heights in front of Champigny with the companies
assembled at Coeuilly failed with heavy loss. As
the result, however, of a renewed flank-attack from the
Hunting-lodge, Faron's Division, which had already been
severely shaken, was obliged to retreat to Champigny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>General Ducrot decided to be content, for that day,
with having established a firm footing on the left bank
of the Marne, and he brought up sixteen batteries to a
position in his front, to secure the wedge of ground he
had gained. On the following day the attack was to be
renewed by all the three Corps.</p>

<p>The Germans, on their part, had to congratulate
themselves on having maintained their ground against
greatly superior numbers. And so in the afternoon the
fight gradually died away, until it broke out again in
the north.</p>

<p>The French IIIrd Corps, marching up the right bank
of the Marne, had occupied Neuilly in force, and had
driven in the outposts of the Saxon 47th Brigade.
Under cover of six batteries the construction of two
military bridges below Neuilly was begun at ten o'clock,
and finished by noon. But just at this time it happened,
as we have seen, that the French were in retreat
from the plateau, so the crossing did not occur until
two o'clock in the afternoon. Bellemare's Division
marched down the valley to Bry, where it closed on
the left flank of the IInd Corps. A regiment of
Zouaves, trying to ascend the plateau from Bry, lost half
its men and all its officers. Notwithstanding, General
Ducrot decided to employ his reinforced strength
in the immediate renewal of the attack on Villiers.</p>

<p>Strengthened by four battalions, the Division advanced
in this direction, although the artillery had not
succeeded in battering down the park wall; repeated
onslaughts by rifle-swarms were repulsed, and finally
the French retreated into the valley. The simultaneous
attacks of Berthaut's Division along the railway
line and of Faron's Division on the Hunting-lodge
also miscarried. Not till darkness had set in did the
firing cease on both sides.</p>

<p>Near Chelles, on the line in which the French IIIrd
Corps had been advancing in the morning, the Crown
Prince of Saxony had collected the 23rd Division; but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
soon as the enemy's real objective was penetrated, he
despatched part of the 47th Brigade and a portion of
the Corps Artillery to the threatened position held by
the Würtembergers. Not less opportunely had General
von Obernitz, as soon as the fighting at Mesly was
over, sent three battalions to the Hunting-lodge. In the
night orders came from the supreme Head-quarter for
the IInd and VIth Corps to send reinforcements to the
endangered points of the line of investment, and the
7th and 21st Brigades arrived at Sucy on the following
day, the 1st of December.</p>

<p>On the French side the attempt to break through
without help from outside was already considered as
well-nigh hopeless, and it was only the fear of popular
indignation which caused the IIIrd Army to remain
longer on the left bank of the Marne. Instead of
attacking, the French began to intrench themselves,
and in order to clear the battle-field a truce was
arranged. The thunder of the cannon from Mont
Avron had to serve for the present to keep up the
spirits of the Parisians. The Germans also worked
at the strengthening of their positions, but, suffering
from the sudden and extreme cold, part at least of the
troops withdrew into quarters further rearward.</p>

<p>The command of the whole of the German Army
between the Marne and the Seine was assumed by
General von Fransecky (commanding IInd Corps).
The Head-quarter of the Army of the Meuse had
already given instructions that Prince George (of
Saxony) with all the available troops of the XIIth
Corps, should make surprise-attacks on Bry and Champigny
in the early morning of the 2nd.</p>

<p>With this object, on the morning specified the 24th
Division assembled at Noisy, the 1st Würtemberg
Brigade at Villiers, and the 7th Prussian Brigade at
the Hunting-lodge.</p>

<p>The foremost battalions of the Saxon Division drove
back the enemy's outposts by a sudden rush, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
100 prisoners, and after storming a barricade entered
Bry. Here ensued an embittered fight in the streets
and houses, in which the 2nd Battalion of the 107th
Regiment lost nearly all its officers. Nevertheless it
maintained its hold on the northern part of the village,
in spite of the heavy fire of the forts.</p>

<p>The Würtembergers also forced an entrance into
Champigny, but soon met with fierce resistance from
the enemy sheltered in the buildings. The previously
occupied Bois de la Lande had to be abandoned, and
General Ducrot now determined to resort to the offensive.
The strong artillery line on his front came into
action at about nine o'clock, and two Divisions deployed
in rear of it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Fusilier battalion of the Colberg
Regiment marched once more from the Hunting-lodge
on Bois de la Lande, and carried it with the first
onslaught. The French, firing heavily from the railway
embankments, struck down the Pomeranians with
clubbed rifles and at the point of the bayonet. A
fierce fight was carried on at the same time at the lime-pits,
where at noon 160 French laid down their arms.
When six Würtemberg and nine Prussian batteries
had been by degrees brought into action against
Champigny, General Hartmann<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> succeeded in getting as
far as the road leading to Bry. As, however, the
batteries were now being masked by their own infantry,
and were suffering, too, under the heavy projectiles fired
from the forts, they were withdrawn into the hollow of
the Hunting-lodge. At two o'clock the 1st Würtemberg
and 7th Prussian Brigades established themselves
firmly in the line from the churchyard of
Champigny to the Bois de la Lande.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French divisions of Bellemare and
Susbielle had reached the battle-field from the right
bank of the Marne. The two Saxon battalions in Bry,
having already lost 36 officers and 638 men, were compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
by the approach of the enemy in very superior
force, to evacuate the village and retire on Noisy, but
not without taking 300 prisoners with them. The rest
of the Saxon forces held Villiers, where the still available
batteries also were in position.</p>

<p>While, at two o'clock, the French were bringing up
a strong artillery mass against this point, four batteries
of the IInd Corps rushed out of the hollow near the
Hunting-lodge at a gallop upon their flank, and opened
fire at a range of 2000 paces. In less than ten minutes
the French batteries fell back and the Prussian batteries
returned to their sheltered position. Several hostile
battalions which, at about three o'clock, attempted a
renewed assault on Villiers, were repulsed with no
difficulty, and at five o'clock the fighting ceased. The
French merely kept up a fire of field and fortress
artillery until dark.</p>

<p>General Ducrot had received information in the
course of the day, that the Army of the Loire was
marching on Fontainebleau, and he was, therefore, very
anxious to continue to maintain his position outside
Paris.</p>

<p>During the night of December 2nd&mdash;3rd, provisions
were procured, and the teams and ammunition of the
batteries were made up; but the approach of support
from without was in no wise confirmed.</p>

<p>The troops were completely exhausted by the previous
disastrous fighting, and the Commander-in-Chief was
justified in apprehending a repulse on the Marne by
the enemy's invigorated forces. He therefore ordered
a retreat, the troops being informed that the attack
should be renewed as soon as their preparedness for
fighting should have been re-established.</p>

<p>Soon after midnight the divisions were assembled
behind the outposts, and the trains were sent back first.
At noon the troops were able to follow over the bridges
at Neuilly, Bry, and Joinville. Only one brigade
remained in position to cover the passage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The retreat was very skilfully covered by a series of
small attacks on the German outposts. The French
batteries had opened fire at Le Plant and Bry by daybreak,
and the withdrawal of the enemy's army was
completely hidden by the thick mist.</p>

<p>General Fransecky assembled the Saxon and the
Würtemberg Divisions in a fighting position at Villiers
and C&oelig;uilly, the 7th Brigade with the Corps-Artillery
of the IInd Corps and two regiments of the VIth at
Chennevières, intending to wait for the expected reinforcement
which the VIth Corps had agreed to furnish
for the 4th. The 23rd Division also received orders
from the Crown Prince of Saxony to cross to the left
bank of the Marne, whilst the Guard Corps had meanwhile
extended its outposts to Chelles.</p>

<p>So remained matters on the 3rd, with the exception
of petty frays, and at four o'clock in the afternoon the
troops were able to return to quarters. When early on
the 4th patrols rode forward towards Bry and Champigny,
they found these places vacated, and the
peninsula of Joinville deserted by the enemy.</p>

<p>The IInd French Army, which had been severely
reduced and its internal cohesion much shaken, returned
to Paris; on its own report it had lost 12,000 men.
The German troops engaged had lost 6200 men, but
resumed their former positions in the investing line.</p>

<p>This energetic attempt on the part of General Ducrot
was the most serious effort that was made for the relief
of Paris. It was directed towards what was at the
moment the weakest point of the investment, but met
with any success only at the outset.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Advance of the Ist Army in November.</span></h2>


<p>The newly-formed levies in northern France were not
remaining inactive. Rouen and Lille were their chief
centres. In front of the latter place, the Somme with
its fortified passages at Ham, Péronne, Amiens, and
Abbeville afforded a line equally advantageous for
attacks to the front or for secure retreat. Isolated
advances had, indeed, on various occasions, been driven
back by detachments of the Army of the Meuse, but
these were too weak to rid themselves of the continued
molestation by pursuit pushed home.</p>

<p>We have already seen how, after the fall of Metz, the
IInd Army marched to the Loire, and the Ist into the
northern departments of France.</p>

<p>A large portion of the Ist Army was at first detained
on the Moselle by having had to undertake the transport
of the numerous prisoners and the observation of
the fortresses which interrupted the communications
with Germany. The whole VIIth Corps was either in
Metz or before Thionville and Montmédy. Of the Ist
Corps, the 1st Division was detached to Rethel,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the 4th
Brigade transported by railway through Soissons to
the investment of La Fère, and the 3rd Cavalry
Division sent on towards the forest of Argonnes. The
remaining five brigades followed with the artillery on
the 7th November.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Marching on a wide front, the force reached the
Oise between Compiègne and Chauny on the 20th.
In front of the right wing the cavalry, supported by a
battalion of Jägers, came in contact with Gardes-Mobiles
at Ham and Guiscard; in face of the infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
columns the hostile bodies fell back on Amiens. It
was learned that 15,000 men were there, and that
reinforcements were continually joining.</p>

<p>On the 25th the 3rd Brigade reached Le Quesnel.
The 15th Division of the VIIIth Corps advanced beyond
Montdidier, and the 16th to Breteuil, whence it established
connection with the Saxon detachments about
Clermont. On the 26th the right wing closed up to Le
Quesnel, the left to Moreuil and Essertaux. The cavalry
scouted forward towards the Somme, the right bank of
which it found occupied. The enemy's attitude indicated
that he was confining himself to the defence of
that position. General von Manteuffel thereupon determined
to attack, without waiting for the arrival of the
1st Division, the transport of which from Rethel was
extraordinarily delayed. His intention, in the first
instance, was to utilize the 27th in drawing closer in
his forces, which were extended along a front of some
nineteen miles. But the battle was unexpectedly
fought on that same day.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Amiens.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(November 17th.)</div>


<p>General Farre, with his 17,500 men distributed into
three brigades, stood eastward of Amiens on the south
bank of the Somme, about Villers Bretonneux and
Longueau along the road to Péronne, holding also the
villages and copses on his front. Besides these troops
there were 8000 Gardes-Mobiles occupying an intrenched
position about two and a half miles in front
of the city.</p>

<p>In accordance with instructions from the Army
Headquarter, General von Goeben (commanding the
VIIIth Corps) had given orders for the 27th that the
15th Division should take up quarters at Fouencamps
and Sains; the 16th at Rumigny and Plachy and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
villages further back; the Corps-Artillery at Grattepanche.
Consequently the VIIIth Corps was to be
assembled before Amiens between the Celle and the
Noye, at the distance, then, of nearly two and a half
miles from the Ist Corps, and divided from it by the
latter brook and the Avre. General von Bentheim
(commanding the 1st Division, Ist Corps<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>) on the other
hand, had sent his advanced guard, the 3rd Brigade,
into quarters north of the Luce.</p>

<p>At an early hour that brigade seized the passages of
the brook at Démuin, Hangard, and Domart. At ten
o'clock it moved forward in order to occupy the
appointed quarters, and as the enemy were already in
possession, a fight began which gradually increased in
magnitude.</p>

<p>The wooded heights on the north bank of the Luce
were taken without any particular resistance, and
maintained in spite of several counter strokes by the
French. The artillery pushed forward through the
intervals of the infantry. On the left the 4th Regiment
seized the village of Gentelles, on the right the
44th Regiment rushed up to within 300 paces of the
left flank of the French position, and by a vigorous
onslaught carried by storm the earthworks at the railway
cutting east of Villers Bretonneux. Soon after
mid-day heavy hostile masses drew up at Bretonneux
and in Cachy, directly opposite the 3rd Brigade,
which was extended along a front of some four miles.</p>

<p>On the left wing of the Germans the 16th Division
had by eleven o'clock already reached its assigned
quarters, and had driven the enemy out of Hébecourt,
as well as out of the woods north of that village towards
Dury. The 15th Division, in compliance with the
enjoined assemblage of the VIIIth Corps on the left bank
of the Noye, moved westward from Moreuil through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Ailly to Dommartin, its advance guard which had been
holding Hailles marching direct on Fouencamps. Thus
it happened that before noon the roads from Roye and
Montdidier between the two Corps were left completely
uncovered by troops on the German side, while a French
brigade was standing at the fork of these roads at
Longueau, though, in fact, it remained absolutely inactive.
This interval was at first screened only by the
numerous retinue and staff escort of the Commander-in-Chief;
and then it was to some extent filled by the
battalion constituting the guard of the headquarter.
As, however, after ten o'clock the French on their side
commenced an attack on the 3rd Brigade, General von
Manteuffel ordered the 15th Division to join in the
fight as far as possible toward the right wing.</p>

<p>After a staunch defence the companies of the 4th
Regiment were driven back out of the Bois de Hangard
towards the declivity of the height in front of Démuin,
and subsequently, having expended all their ammunition,
the defenders of Gentelles were driven back to
Domart.</p>

<p>General von Strubberg (commanding 30th Infantry
Brigade, VIIIth Corps), on instructions from the scene of
combat in front of the Luce, had sent four battalions in
that direction, which crossed the Avre, but came under
such a heavy fire from the Bois de Gentelles that their
further advance was prevented, and they had to change
front against the wood. Behind them, however, the
other detachments of the 30th Brigade pressed forward
to St. Nicolas on the right bank, and to Boves on the
left, and in co-operation with the 29th Brigade drove
the French from the neighbouring Ruinenberg.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a part of the approaching 1st Division
came up behind the 3rd Brigade. The artillery positions
were considerably strengthened, and the cannon
fire was directed against the earthworks south of Bretonneux.
As the nearest support the Crown Prince's
Regiment went forward, and soon the French were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
again driven out of the Bois de Hangard. The East
Prussians following them up, took cover in front of the
earthworks; several detachments of the 4th and 44th
Regiments gradually collected there from the neighbouring
woods, and the enemy was then driven back
from this position. Thirteen batteries now silenced
the French artillery, and, after they had fired for some
time on Bretonneux, the place was, at four o'clock,
seized by the Prussians pouring in from all sides with
drums beating. The French in its interior made
only a weak defence at isolated points; for the most
part they hurried over the Somme at Corbie under
cover of the darkness, and with the loss of 180 unwounded
prisoners.</p>

<p>When, somewhat later, the French General Lecointe
advanced with the reserve brigade on Domart, he found
that crossing point already in possession of the 1st
Division, and turned back. Cachy only was held by
the French till late in the evening.</p>

<p>The troops of the Ist Corps were distributed for the
night in the hamlets to the south of the Luce; but
the outposts were established on the northern bank of
the Somme, and Bretonneux also remained occupied.</p>

<p>On the left wing of the battle-field the 16th Division
had advanced to Dury, and had driven the French out
of the neighbouring churchyard, but had been forced to
withdraw from an attack on the enemy's extensive and
strongly defended line of intrenchment. It bivouacked
behind Dury.</p>

<p>It was night before General von Manteuffel received
information which proved that the enemy had been
completely defeated. Early in the morning of the
28th the patrols of the Ist Corps found the region
clear of the enemy as far as the Somme, and all the
bridges across the river destroyed. At noon General
von Goeben entered Amiens, the citadel of which
capitulated two days later with its garrison of 400 men
and 30 cannon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>One peculiarity of the battle of the 27th November
was the disproportionately great extent of the battle-field
to the number of the troops engaged. General
Farre, with 25,000 men in round numbers, covered a
front of about fourteen miles from Pont de Metz south
of Amiens to the east of Villers Bretonneux, and with
the Somme close on his rear. The Germans attacked
on approximately the same breadth of front, with the
result that there was a break in the middle of their
line. The danger caused by this gap was not taken
advantage of during the morning through the inactivity
of the enemy, and it was then nullified by the
occupation of St. Nicolas.</p>

<p>The superiority of numbers was on the side of the
Germans, for, although of the approaching 1st Division
only the Crown Prince's Regiment could take part in
the fighting, they were 30,000 strong. The 3rd
Brigade bore the brunt of the battle, losing 630
men and 34 officers out of a total of 1300. The
French also lost about 1300, besides 1000 reported
missing. Part of the National Guard threw down
their arms and fled to their homes. The main body of
the French Corps retired on Arras.</p>

<p>Immediately after the battle the Ist Army was
reinforced by the 4th Brigade, which had been brought
from La Fère.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Reduction of La Fère.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(November 27th.)</div>


<p>This little fortress became of importance since it
closed the line of railway passing through Rheims,
both to Amiens and to Paris. Lying in open, wet, low
ground overflowed by the Somme and its tributaries,
it was difficult of approach; otherwise, the fortifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
merely consisted of an isolated wall, with sundry
earthworks close in front of it, and it was entirely
seen into from heights on the east at a distance of not
more than 1500 metres.</p>

<p>The brigade (4th of Ist Corps) as a preliminary
measure had invested La Fère on the 15th November,
and when the siege-train arrived from Soissons with
thirty-two heavy guns, seven batteries were built and
armed during the night of the 25th on the heights
already mentioned. On the following morning these
opened fire, and on the 27th the place capitulated.
Gardes-Mobiles to the number of 2300 were taken
prisoners, and the most serviceable of the 113 guns
found were brought away to arm the citadel of Amiens.
The reinforcement of the Ist Army by the VIIth Corps
meanwhile was not yet even in prospect, since the latter
still had further work to do on the Moselle; the
greater part of the 14th Division only arrived before
Thionville on November 13th.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Reduction of Thionville.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(November 24th.)</div>


<p>This fortress, shut in on all sides by hills, was
entirely without bomb-proof protection; direct
approach from the south was, on the other hand,
rendered difficult by artificial inundations, and on
the west and north by swamps. General von Kameke
therefore decided to await the result of a heavy
bombardment before resorting to a regular attack.
Batteries were erected on both banks of the Moselle,
and on the morning of the 22nd eighty-five guns
opened fire. At first the fortress answered briskly.
In the following night the infantry detailed to the task
of throwing up the first parallel, advanced to within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
600 paces of the west front, but, in consequence
of pouring rain and the condition of the ground the
work made but small progress. However, on the 24th
at mid-day the commandant proposed negotiations
for the surrender of the place. The garrison, 4000
strong, with the exception of the National Guard
belonging to the place, became prisoners and were sent
to Germany; and 199 guns, besides a considerable
amount of supplies, arms and ammunition, fell into the
hands of the conqueror.</p>

<p>The 14th Division was now required to lay siege to
the northern frontier fortresses, which would occupy it
for some time. The 13th Division, by orders from the
supreme Head-quarter, was assigned to the operations
in southern France.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Orleans.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(December 3rd and 4th.)</div>


<p>When soon after noon of 2nd December the telegraphed
order to take the offensive against Orleans
reached the headquarter of the IInd Army, the Prince
on the same day assembled the Xth Corps at Beaune la
Rolande and Boynes, the IIIrd at Pithiviers, and the
IXth at Bazoches les Gallerandes. By evening the
collected forces had their marching orders.</p>

<p>The attack was to comprise two days of fighting.
The IIIrd Corps was first to advance on Loury by way
of Chilleurs aux Bois; the Xth was to follow to Chilleurs;
and the IXth was to attack Artenay at half-past
nine. The 1st Cavalry Division supported by infantry
was to be on observation on the left flank towards the
Yonne; the 6th was to follow the right wing. The
Grand Duke, to whom it had been left to arrange the
details of his own march westward of the Paris main
road, ordered the 22nd Division to support the attack
on Artenay, the Bavarian Corps to advance on Lumeau,
the 17th Division to remain for the present at Anneux.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
The 4th Cavalry Division was charged with the duty
of scouting on the right flank.</p>

<p>So early as nine o'clock in the morning on the 3rd of
December the IIIrd Corps met eight battalions and six
batteries of the enemy at Santeau. The 12th Brigade
and the artillery of the 6th Division intercalated in the
columns of march in rear of the foremost battalions,
thereupon deployed about La Brosse. After a few
rounds a battery of the left wing had to be withdrawn
from the fight which had now commenced; on the right,
on the other hand, the Corps-Artillery gradually came up,
and by noon seventy-eight Prussian guns were in action.</p>

<p>The French, yielding to strength so overwhelming,
retired on Chilleurs; but, when the German batteries
had advanced within 2000 paces of that place, and the
right flank of the former was threatened by an assault
of the Jäger battalions, they began a retreat towards
the forest, and at three o'clock part of the 5th Division
followed them up through the glen leading to the
southward, and the 6th by the high road. As these had
been obstructed in many places, it was six o'clock in
the evening before the clearing by Loury was reached.</p>

<p>On the right, heavy musketry-firing was heard in the
region of Neuville, and tidings also arrived that on the
left the French had occupied Nancray.</p>

<p>In consequence of this, a reinforcement from the
reserve remaining in Chilleurs was brought up; one
regiment was thrown out fronting towards the west, a
second towards the east, and under cover of the outposts
extended toward the south the remainder of the
troops went into bivouac and quarters at Loury.</p>

<p>The IXth Corps had first assembled at Château
Gaillard on the main road to Paris, and then advanced
along the chaussée through Dambron against Villereau.
At Assas it met the enemy, who was soon driven back
by its artillery, and disappeared towards Artenay.
At about ten o'clock an obstinate contest was engaged
in against the batteries of the 2nd French Division in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
position here, in which part of the Corps-Artillery presently
bore part, seconded later by the batteries of the
22nd Division, which had come up to Poupry. General
Martineau retreated slowly by successive detachments,
his artillery leading, before the overwhelming fire of
ninety guns, on La Croix Briquet and Ferme d'Arblay.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock the Germans occupied Artenay,
and after half an hour's rest they renewed the offensive.
There occurred a long and obstinate fire-fight both of
infantry and artillery, while the 22nd Division pushed
forward on the enemy's left flank. At two o'clock his
guns were silenced, the left-wing column of the IXth
Corps seized the farm of Arblay, and the centre by
hard fighting drove the enemy back along the high
road through La Croix Briquet to Andeglou, where
under cover of the marine artillery resistance was kept
up till dark.</p>

<p>General Puttkamer<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> had brought up five batteries to
within 800 paces of Chevilly, and the 22nd Division
was advancing on the burning village, when the chief
Command gave the order to halt, the Grand Duke hesitating
to engage in a night attack on the intrenched
village. But when, soon after, a Hussar patrol brought
the information that it was already evacuated, General
von Wittich ordered its occupation. The troops
bivouacked in a heavy snowstorm, in and to the rear
of La Croix Briquet.</p>

<p>About the time of the first advance the IXth Corps
had sent a detachment of four Hessian battalions leftward
against St. Lyé. They met with opposition at
La Tour, drove the enemy back on St. Germain, but
could not dislodge him from that place.</p>

<p>When the Xth Corps, marching round by Pithiviers
unmolested, about three o'clock reached the vicinity of
Chilleurs in rear of the IIIrd Corps, part of the 20th
Division went on in the direction of the fighting about
Neuville, the noise of which in the evening was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
heard at Loury. Darkness had already come on and
precluded the use of artillery, but the infantry broke
into the village at several points. But it found the
streets barricaded, and met with obstinate resistance,
so that the prosecution of the attack had to be postponed
till the following day.</p>

<p>The XVth French Corps had sustained single-handed
the onslaught of three Prussian Corps. Strong masses
of the Army of Orleans, to right and to left of that
Corps, made but feeble efforts in the course of the
day to support it. General Chanzy alone, when at
about two o'clock he heard heavy firing from Artenay,
ordered forward the 2nd Division of the XVIth Corps,
though he had already that morning begun his retreat
on St. Péravy and Boulay. But this reinforcement
encountered the Prussian 17th Division, which, coming
up from Anneux, was on the point of joining in the
fight at Andeglou, and with it the Bavarian Corps
advancing from Lumeau. Their strong united artillery
in position at Chameul and Sougy, soon forced the
enemy to retire. Douzy and then Huêtre were taken,
and the château of Chevilly was occupied by the 17th
Division. Here too darkness put an end to the fighting.
The troops of the right wing quartered at Provenchères,
Chameul and rearward.</p>

<p>Thus the German army had made its way without
very heavy fighting to within nine miles of Orleans.
The French, indeed, had maintained their ground till
evening in the neighbourhood of Neuville, but the
forces holding on there were ordered to retire in the
night. They were to gain the road from Pithiviers by
Rebréchien, and make a circuit by Orleans to Chevilly.
But they thus came under the fire of the IIIrd German
Corps quartered in Loury, and fled in disorder back
into the forest, whence they attempted to reach their
destination by detachments.</p>

<p>It was only to be expected that the French would
stoutly defend their intrenchments at Gidy and Cercottes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
on the following day, if only to keep open their
way of retreat through Orleans. Prince Frederick
Charles therefore ordered the Grand Duke's Detachment
and the IXth Corps to make an encompassing
attack on both points on the 4th. The IIIrd Corps
was to advance from Loury on Orleans, and the Xth,
again forming the reserve, was to follow to Chevilly.</p>

<p>General d'Aurelle had retired to Saran on the evening
of the 3rd. Here he saw the 2nd Division of the
XVth Corps fleeing by in utter rout, and heard also that
the 1st had failed to make a stand at Chilleurs. The
Corps of his right wing were altogether shattered as
regarded their internal cohesion by the battle of Beaune,
and those of his left no less by the fight at Loigny.
The French General could not but dread being driven
on the Loire with undisciplined masses, and the consequent
block of the only passage of the river at Orleans.
He decided therefore on an eccentric retreat. Only the
XVth Corps was to retire by Orleans; General Crouzat
was to cross the Loire at Gien, General Chanzy at
Beaugency. The reassemblage remained to be attempted
behind the Sauldre. The necessary dispositions
were made during the night, and communicated to the
Government. From the Board of Green Cloth at
Tours, counter orders of course came next morning to
maintain the Orleans position, which practically was
already wrecked; but the General adhered firmly to his
own determination.</p>

<p>On December 4th the IIIrd Army Corps marched
out of Loury in two columns by the high road and the
tracks through Vennecy. Both bodies reached Boigny
by noon, having met only stragglers. A detachment
was sent to the right to Neuville, which made prize
of seven derelict guns and many rifles. To the left,
another detachment occupied Chézy on the Loire.
After a short rest the main columns advanced, and by
two o'clock the 6th Division reached Vaumainbert,
which was occupied by detachments of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
XVth Corps. Although the country was not open
enough to allow of the employment of artillery, the
place was taken by the Brandenburgers in spite of the
stout resistance of the French Marine Infantry, and the
fire of the batteries on the heights to the north of St.
Loup could now be directed on the suburb of Orleans.</p>

<p>The 5th Division had meanwhile come up behind the
6th and took part in the fight.</p>

<p>The XXth French Corps, which was still at Chambon,
in the eastern part of the forest opposite Beaune la
Rolande, had received orders at four in the morning
from Tours direct, to march on Orleans. Contrary
orders had previously arrived from General d'Aurelle,
but nothing subsequently came to hand. General
Crouzat had, as a precaution, sent his train across the
Loire by way of Jargeau, and then marched in the prescribed
direction. When, at half-past two he met at
Pont aux Moines the German detachment despatched to
Chézy, he determined to cut his way through by force
of arms; but as General von Stülpnagel reinforced his
two battalions with the rest of his Division, the French
general gave up that attempt and retreated across the
river, making the passage at Jargeau.</p>

<p>On the German side the attack on St. Loup<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> was
unsuccessful; and since from the locality of the fighting
on the part of the other Corps no tidings reached him,
and darkness was approaching, General von Alvensleben
postponed any further attack on the city till the
following day.</p>

<p>North of Orleans the IXth Army Corps advanced
from La Croix Briquet on the intrenched position of
Cercottes. At about one o'clock the foremost detachments
of infantry entered the place. The 2nd Division
of the French XVth Corps was driven back by the fire
of the artillery into the vineyards in front of the city.
Here the infantry alone could continue the struggle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
The French defended every tenable spot, and especially
in the railway station close to Orleans held their own
with great persistency. It and the adjacent deep road-cutting
were fortified with barricades and rifle-pits,
and armed with naval guns. It was not till nightfall,
about half-past five, that these posts were abandoned,
but the contest was continued further back. To avoid
street-fighting in the dark, General von Manstein
broke off the fight for the day at about seven o'clock.</p>

<p>The advanced guard of the 17th Division of the Grand
Duke's Detachment had found Gidy intrenched and
strongly occupied. But at the approach of the IXth
Corps the French about eleven o'clock thought proper
to abandon the position, leaving behind eight guns.
The German Division, to avoid the wood, now moved
in a westerly direction on Boulay, whither the 22nd
and the 2nd Cavalry Division followed as a reserve.</p>

<p>Here the Bavarian Corps and the 4th Cavalry
Division were already engaged in a fight, having previously
driven the French out of Bricy and Janvry.
When the artillery had for some time been in action,
General von der Tann passed to the assault at about
twelve o'clock. But the French did not wait for this;
they beat a hasty retreat, leaving some of their guns in
the defences.</p>

<p>The 2nd Cavalry Division took up the pursuit. The
4th Hussars of the 5th Brigade, trotting forward through
Montaigu, charged a dismounted French battery and
seized all its guns; another near Ormes was left to be
carried off by the horse battery. From thence a strong
body of French horse suddenly appeared on the left
flank of the 4th Brigade as it was crossing the Châteaudun
road. But the Blücher Hussars, promptly
wheeling into line, drove the enemy back through the
village on Ingré.</p>

<p>The 4th Cavalry Division was placed on observation
on the right flank of the Detachment; and the Hussars
of the 2nd Life Regiment here rode down 250 men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
forming the escort of a waggon column escaping by the
road to Châteaudun, and captured the convoy.</p>

<p>While the Germans were thus converging on Orleans
from the east and north, in the west the XVIIth French
Corps and the 1st Division of the XVIth were still in the
field about Patay and St. Péravy. General Chanzy had
assembled the latter about Coinces, and, to protect himself
against its threatened attack on his flank, General
von der Tann formed front at Bricy with his 3rd Infantry
Brigade, the Cuirassiers, and the artillery reserve.
The 4th Cavalry Division marched on Coinces, where
General von Bernhardi, clearing a wide ditch with four
squadrons of Uhlans, drove a body of French horse
back on St. Péravy without its having been able to do
more than fire one carbine-volley. Other squadrons
of the 9th Brigade rode down the French tirailleurs,
and pursued the cavalry till it reached the protection
of strong bodies of infantry. The 8th Brigade was in
observation toward Patay, and after that place had
come under the fire of a battery and been abandoned,
General Chanzy gave up all further attack and retired
behind the forest of Montpipeau.</p>

<p>The 2nd Cavalry Division now made for the Loire
immediately below Orleans. Its artillery destroyed a
bridge at Chapelle over which a baggage-train was
passing, and compelled the French troops, which were
marching towards Cléry along the further bank, to flee
back to Orleans. Two military railway-trains from
thence were not to be stopped by the firing, but a train
coming from Tours, in which, as it happened, was
Gambetta himself, returned thither with all speed.</p>

<p>The Bavarian Corps meanwhile was advancing by the
high road, and the 22nd Division, in touch with the IXth
Corps, on the old Châteaudun road; the 17th Division
between the two on La Borde. This last Division
at about 3.30 had to carry on its way the strongly
defended village of Heurdy; and when the Bavarians
from Ormes turned to the right on Ingré, it proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
by the high road towards St. Jean de la Ruelle.
Having overcome all opposition there too, the head of
the Division reached the gates of Orleans at about six
o'clock.</p>

<p>General von Tresckow entered into negotiations with
the military authorities there for the orderly occupation
of the town. An agreement was arrived at by ten
o'clock, and shortly after midnight the Grand Duke
marched in with the 17th Division, promptly followed
by the 2nd Bavarian Brigade. The bridge over the
Loire, which the French had not found time to blow
up, was secured with all speed. The rest of the troops
found quarters for the night, to the west and north of
the city.</p>

<p>The peremptory orders from the Government to hold
Orleans had shaken General d'Aurelle's original determination.
When the mass of the XVth Corps arrived
there in the forenoon, he was anxious to make a final
stand. But the necessary orders could not be transmitted
to the Corps of the right wing, nor carried out
by those of the left; and by five o'clock the General in
command was convinced of the futility of any further
resistance. The artillery of the XVth Corps was in the
first instance forwarded to La Ferté St. Aubin; the
infantry followed. The XXth Corps, as we have seen,
was at Jargeau; the XVIIIth recrossed the Loire at
Sully; the XVIth and XVIIth moved off westward
in the direction of Beaugency, but remained on the
right bank of the river.</p>

<p>The two days' battle had cost the Germans 1700
men; the French lost 20,000, of whom 1800 were taken
prisoners. Their large army lately massed before
Orleans, was now split up into three separate bodies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Offensive Operations South, East, and West.</span></h2>


<p>The troops were too much exhausted for immediate
pursuit in any of these three directions.</p>

<p>It was ordered that only the 6th Cavalry Division,
reinforced by an infantry detachment of the 18th Division,
should follow up the enemy making to the southward,
ascertain his whereabouts, and destroy the concentration
of the railways from Bourges, Orleans and Tours
at the Vierzon junction. This Cavalry was in quarters
to the north of the city; the French XVth Corps had a
considerable start of it, and the main body of the latter
had reached Salbris, when, on December 6th, two days
after the battle, General von Schmidt (commanding
14th Brigade, 6th Cavalry Division) arrived by a forced
march at La Ferté St. Aubin. Here he found a detachment
of the 18th Division, which had already driven
the French rear-guard back on La Motte Beuvron, but
was now recalled to the Loiret. Only two companies
of the 36th Regiment and one of pioneers joined the
further advance, and followed the cavalry partly in
waggons and partly on gun-limbers.</p>

<p>On the 7th, under direct orders from Tours, the
French Corps left the high road to the south, and made
a flank march of twenty miles in an easterly direction
to Aubigny Ville. The cavalry, supported to the best
of their power by its artillery and the small infantry
detachment, had a sharp fight with the French rear-guard
at Nouan le Fuzelier, and again in the evening
at Salbris, in which the French finally had the best of
it. The neighbourhood being very thinly populated,
the Division had to return in the night to Nouan, to
find shelter from the bitter winter weather.</p>

<p>Long before daybreak on the 8th, the French rear-guard
evacuated Salbris to avoid a further encounter
with the enemy, whose strength was greatly overestimated.
After some slight skirmishes the Cavalry
Division reached Vierzon that evening. The telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
wires were cut and the railway line torn up in
several places, 70 goods vans were made prize of,
the direction of the enemy's retreat was ascertained,
and any offensive movement on the part of the
French from that side for the time was reckoned very
improbable.</p>

<p>The Division had fulfilled its task; it was now
ordered to leave one brigade in observation, and to
advance in the direction of Blois with the rest. General
(Count) von der Groeben (commanding 14th Cavalry
Brigade) maintained his positions at Vierzon and Salbris
till the 14th.</p>

<p>The winter marches of the 6th Cavalry Division were
exceptionally arduous. It was almost impossible to
travel excepting by the high roads, and they were so
slippery with ice that it was often necessary to dismount
and lead the horses. The inhabitants of the Sologne
were extremely hostile, and troopers patrolling in
advance were fired upon in every village. The French
forces, on the other hand, made but a feeble resistance.
Numerous prisoners and large quantities of abandoned
war matériel bore witness to a hasty retreat, in many
cases indicated panic-flight. Nevertheless, in spite of
much desultory marching and counter-marching, the
Corps on December 13th finally succeeded in joining the
right wing of the Army of Orleans at Bourges. The
plight in which it arrived there may be gathered from
the telegraphic <i>Correspondance Urgente</i> of the Tours
Government with General Bourbaki, who, when General
d'Aurelle was dismissed from the command in chief, had
assumed command of the three Corps.</p>

<p>The delegate Freycinet, who was no doubt kept well
informed by the country people, assured General
Bourbaki that he had only a weak force of cavalry in
his front, and called upon him repeatedly, and in the
most urgent terms, to advance against Blois. The
General retorted that if he were to undertake that
operation, not a gun, not a man of his three Corps would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
ever be seen again. His intention was to retreat
without delay from Bourges on St. Amand, and if
necessary yet further; all he dreaded was lest he should
be attacked before he could accomplish this, and so
be involved in overwhelming disaster.</p>

<p>The Minister of War himself went to Bourges, but
he too renounced all idea of a serious offensive movement
when he saw the disorder of the troops; "I have
never seen anything so wretched." It was with difficulty
that he carried his point that the Corps should not
retreat, but should await events under cover of one of
them pushed forward towards Vierzon.</p>

<p>On the day when General von Schmidt entered
Vierzon, the XVth Corps was in the vicinity of Henrichemont,
at about an equal distance with himself
from Bourges. The XVIIIth and XXth Corps were
at Aubigny Ville and Cernay, from two to three
marches away. It can scarcely be doubted that if the
18th Division had followed the advance of the 6th
Cavalry Division, possession would have been obtained
of Bourges and of the vast military establishments
there.</p>

<p>To the east of Orleans the IIIrd German Corps
marched up the river through Châteauneuf. It met
only stragglers, till on the 7th two Divisions of the
XVIIIth French Corps attempted to cross to the right
bank of the Loire at Gien. There came about an
advanced-guard fight at Nevoy, with the result that
these Divisions retreated across the bridge in the night,
and continued their march on Bourges.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Fighting of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(December 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th.)</div>


<p>The Grand Duke's Detachment stood westward, close
to the retreating left wing of the enemy. In contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to the disorder of the right wing, General Chanzy, probably
the most capable of all the leaders whom the
Germans had to encounter in the battle-field, had very
rapidly in so great measure restored the discipline and
spirit of his defeated troops, that they were able not
only to make a stand, but even to take the offensive.
They had, it is true, been considerably reinforced by
the newly formed XXIst Corps and by Camô's Division.
The latter formed the advanced guard at Meung; behind
it were the XVIth Corps at Beaugency, the
XVIIth at Cravant, and the XXIst at St. Laurent on
the edge of the forest of Marchénoir.</p>

<p>On the day after the fight the troops of the Grand
Duke were given a rest-day; only the cavalry pursued
the French. The 4th Cavalry Division reached
Ouzouer; the 2nd came upon considerable masses of
infantry behind Meung.</p>

<p>On the 7th, the Grand Duke's forces advanced on a
very wide front. The 17th Division, on the left wing,
marched on Meung, where its artillery opened a combat
with that of the enemy. The French held possession of
the narrow lanes of the village, which further westward
was pierced by the main road to Beaugency. Towards
four o'clock a Mecklenburg battalion carried Langlochère
by storm, but found itself threatened on both
sides by the approach of hostile columns. On the left
Foinard was presently occupied, and a gun captured
there, while on the right the 1st Bavarian Brigade
advanced on La Bourie. Here, almost at the same
moment, the 2nd Cavalry Division came up by by-roads
from Renardière, having driven the enemy out of Le
Bardon by the fire of its guns. The Bavarians had now
to march out to meet a hostile mass advancing from
Grand Chatre. Supported by the horse batteries, they
maintained till nightfall a stubborn fight, which ended
in the retreat of the French on Beaumont.</p>

<p>During this conflict on the left wing of the Detachment,
the 1st Bavarian Division, considerably on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
right, were marching on Baccon, the 22nd on Ouzouer;
and finding that the French were offering a determined
resistance, the Grand Duke decided on closing in his
forces to the left.</p>

<p><i>December 8th.</i>&mdash;To this end the 22nd Division moved
southward from Ouzouer through Villermain. After
repulsing the swarms of tirailleurs which attacked its
left flank under cover of a thick fog, General von
Wittich directed his march on Cravant, to effect a
junction with the right wing of the 1st Bavarian Division
already engaged in a hot struggle. They had repulsed
an attack of the enemy pushed forward from
Villechaumont, and the 2nd (Bavarian) Division advanced
by the road from Cravant to Beaugency; but
when three French Divisions came on afresh, it retreated
on Beaumont. Here it found support from the 1st
(Bavarian Division) and 17 batteries were gradually
brought up into the fighting line. Their fire and an
impetuous attack from three Bavarian brigades at last
forced the enemy to fall back, and the position on the
high road was recovered.</p>

<p>The French now, on their side, brought up a strong
force of artillery, and prepared to advance on Cravant
with their XVIIth Corps. But the 22nd German Division
having taken Beauvert and Layes by the way, had
already reached Cravant at about one o'clock, and was
in position there with the 4th Cavalry Division on
its right and the 2nd on its left. So when, at about
three o'clock, dense French columns advanced on
Cravant, they were repulsed by a powerful counter-stroke
delivered by the 44th Brigade, in conjunction
with the Bavarians, and were soon driven out
of Layes, which they had entered while advancing.
The five batteries nearest to Cravant had suffered
so severely meanwhile that they had to be withdrawn.
When finally at about four o'clock the Bavarian
battalions advanced to storm the height in their front,
they were met by fresh troops of the enemy, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
losing a great part of their officers were compelled
to retreat on the artillery position at Beaumont.
Later, however, the French abandoned Villechaumont.</p>

<p>On the left wing of the Detachment the 17th Division
pursued the retreating French through Vallées and
Villeneuve, and then at about noon made an attack
on Messas. The defence was obstinate, and it was
not till dusk that it succeeded in gaining full possession
of the place. The artillery directed its fire on dense
masses showing about Vernon, the infantry stormed the
height of Beaugency, and finally forced its way into
the town itself, where a French battery fell into its
hand. Camô's Division then retired on Tavers, and at
midnight General von Tresckow fell upon Vernon,
whence the French, taken entirely by surprise, fled to
Bonvalet.</p>

<p>The Headquarter of the IInd Army had determined
to set in march on Bourges the IIIrd, Xth, and IXth
Corps, from Gien, from Orleans, and also from Blois.
But the Detachment in its advance on Blois by
the right bank of the Loire had met with unexpected
resistance lasting for two days. In the supreme
Headquarter at Versailles it was regarded as indispensable
that the Grand Duke should immediately be
reinforced by at least one Division. Telegraphic orders
to that effect arrived at ten o'clock on December 9th.
The IXth Corps, which was already on the march along
the left bank and had found no enemy in its front,
could not give the requisite support, since all the
bridges over the river had been blown up. The IIIrd
Corps was therefore ordered to leave only a detachment
in observation at Gien, and to turn back to
Orleans. The Xth Corps was to call in its detachments
standing eastward of the city and march forward
to Meung. Meanwhile on the 9th the Detachment
remained still quite unsupported while actually confronting
with four Infantry Divisions, eleven French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Divisions. And early on that morning General Chanzy
took the offensive.</p>

<p><i>December 9th.</i>&mdash;The two Prussian Divisions at Beauvert
and Messas stood firmly awaiting the hostile onslaught.
The two Bavarian Divisions, because of their
severe losses, were held in reserve at Cravant, but soon
had to come up into the fighting line, when at seven
o'clock strong columns of the enemy advanced on Le
Mée.</p>

<p>Dense swarms of tirailleurs were repulsed both there
and before Vernon, and were later shattered by the fire
of the devoted German artillery, which silenced the
French guns and then directed its fire on Villorceau.
In spite of a stout defence, this village was
carried and occupied about half-past ten by the Bavarian
infantry. The French advance on Villechaumont
in greatly superior force was also repulsed, with the
assistance of three battalions and two batteries of the
22nd Division. The Thüringers<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> then stormed Cernay,
where 200 French laid down their arms, and one of
their batteries lost its teams and limbers.</p>

<p>On the right wing of the Detachment, in consequence
of a misunderstanding, the Germans evacuated
Layes and Beauvert, and the French occupied these
villages. However, with the assistance of the 2nd
Bavarian Brigade, the 44th (Brigade) drove them out
again from both places. Further to the north, the
4th Cavalry Division was in observation of a French
detachment approaching Villermain.</p>

<p>The French made renewed efforts, advancing again
at mid-day on Cravant in strong columns; but this
movement General Tresckow took in flank from Messas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
He left only a weak detachment in Beaugency, and
secured himself towards Tavers in the villages on his
left. The main body of the 17th Division advanced
on Bonvalet, reinforced the hardly-pressed Bavarians
in Villorceau, and occupied itself Villemarceau in front
of that place. Here the Division had to maintain a
severe struggle, at about three o'clock, with close
columns of the French XVIth and XVIIth Corps.
The infantry rushing on the enemy with cheers succeeded,
however, in repulsing him and holding its
ground in spite of a hot fire. At the same time three
Bavarian battalions, accompanied by cavalry and artillery,
marched up from Cravant and drove the French
out of Villejouan. Yet further to the right a battalion
of the 32nd Regiment took possession of Ourcelle. A
line from thence to Tavers defined the section of terrain
laboriously wrung from the enemy.</p>

<p>The fight ended with the retreat of the enemy on
Josnes and Dugny.</p>

<p>On this day the IIIrd Corps was still on the march to
Orleans. The IXth from its position on the left bank,
could only take part in the fighting by the fire of its
artillery on Meung and Beaugency. It was not till
near Blois that it met French detachments. Fifty
men of one of the Hessian battalions carried the defended
château of Chambord lying rightward of the
line of march, and there took 200 prisoners and made
prize of twelve ammunition waggons with their
teams.</p>

<p>Of the Xth Corps only the head of its infantry reached
Meung, but it sent forward a regiment of Hussars
with eight batteries, which arrived at Grand Chatre
by about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>By order of the Headquarter of the IInd Army the
Bavarian Corps was now to retire to Orleans, to recruit
after its heavy losses. But even after the arrival
of the Xth Corps the Grand Duke had still in his
front an enemy double his strength, and instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
engaging in a pursuit he had rather to study how to
maintain himself on the defensive.</p>

<p><i>December 10th.</i>&mdash;At dawn General Chanzy renewed
his attack, which even the Bavarians were presently
required to join in repulsing.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock the French XVIIth Corps rushed
in dense masses on Origny, took there 150 prisoners,
and forced its way into Villejouan. This advance was
met directly in front by the 43rd Brigade at Cernay,
and by the 4th Bavarian Brigade with six batteries
at Villechaumont; while on the right flank General von
Tresckow pushed forward on Villorceau and Villemarceau.
In this latter village two of his battalions, supported
by four batteries, resisted every onslaught of the
French from Origny and Toupenay. At noon the main
body of the 17th Division advanced to the recapture of
Villejouan. Here the French made an obstinate stand.
An embittered and bloody fight in the streets and
houses was prolonged till four o'clock, and then fresh
troops of the enemy came up to recover the post
the Germans still held in one detached farmstead.
The artillery mass of the Prussian Division had, however,
deployed to the south of Villemarceau; it was
joined by two horse batteries of the Xth Corps, and the
batteries of the 22nd Division also came into action from
Cernay. The concentric fire of this body of artillery
wrecked the subsequent attacks of the XVIIth French
Corps.</p>

<p>Beaugency was now occupied by part of the Xth
Corps. During the previous days the left flank of the
German fighting position had a secure point d'appui
on the Loire, but on the right such a support had been
wholly lacking. The French had nevertheless hitherto
made no attempt to take advantage of their superiority
by a wider extension of their front. For the first
time on this day did they come in on the unprotected
left flank of their enemy. The greater part of the
XXIst Corps deployed opposite to it, between Poisly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and Mézierès, and at half-past ten strong columns advanced
on Villermain. The Bavarians were compelled
to take up with their 2nd Brigade the "hook" formation
from Jouy to Coudray. Seven batteries were
brought up into that line, and on its right flank the 4th
Cavalry Division stood in readiness to act. By two
o'clock two more horse batteries, and from Cravant
four batteries of the Xth Corps arrived, which massed
there with three brigades as a reserve. The fire of over
a hundred German guns compelled the French to hurry
their artillery out of action at three o'clock, and weak
independent attacks by their infantry were repulsed
without difficulty by the Germans persevering staunchly
on the defence.</p>

<p>The French losses in this four days' battle are
unknown. The Detachment lost 3400 men, of
whom the larger half belonged to the two Bavarian
Divisions.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke had succeeded in holding his own
against three Corps of the enemy till the arrival of the
first reinforcement, and this he owed to the bravery of
all his troops, and not least to the exertions of the artillery.
This arm alone lost 255 men and 356 horses.
Its material was tasked to the utmost, so that finally
almost all the steel guns of the light batteries of the
22nd Division, and most of the Bavarian, were rendered
useless by the burning out of their vent-pieces.</p>

<p>The IIIrd Corps had on this day just arrived at St.
Denis, and the IXth at Vienne opposite Blois; but
here, too, the bridge over the Loire was found to be
blown up.</p>

<p>On the French side, General Chanzy had learnt from
the telegraphic correspondence of the Government at
Tours with General Bourbaki, that nothing had come
of that commander's attempt to divert part of the German
IInd Army upon himself. The long delay gave
General Chanzy the daily apprehension of an attack
by it with its full strength; and he therefore decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
on a retreat, which resulted in the removal of the
Assembly from Tours to Bordeaux.</p>

<p>In the Grand Duke's Head-quarter the renewed
offensive had been decided on for December 11th. The
villages in his front remained strongly occupied, and
it was only at noon of that day that the enemy's
retreat became known. He was at once pursued on
the left by the Xth Corps, and on the right, south of
the forest of Marchénoir, by the Detachment. On the
north, the 4th Cavalry Division took up the scouting.</p>

<p>A thaw had followed the hard frost, making the
march equally difficult for friend and foe. The Germans
found the roads littered with abandoned waggons
and cast-away arms; the bodies of men and horses lay
unburied in the fields, and in the villages were hundreds
of wounded uncared for. Several thousands of
stragglers were captured.</p>

<p>The directions<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of the Chief of the General Staff from
Versailles suggested an immediate pursuit, which should
render the enemy incapable of further action for some
time to come; but not to be maintained beyond Tours.
The IInd Army was then to assemble at Orleans and
the Detachment at Chartres, and the troops were to
obtain the rest they needed. From the former point
constant and strict watch could be kept on General
Bourbaki's army, and to this end a connection was to
be made with General von Zastrow, who with the
VIIth Corps was to reach Châtillon sur Seine on the
13th. But the operations in this quarter were not to
extend beyond Bourges and Nevers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>
<p>The IInd Army was accordingly in the first instance
marched toward the Loir, and on the 13th reached
the line Oucques&mdash;Conan&mdash;Blois, which last town was
found evacuated.</p>

<p>On the 14th the 17th Division marched to Morée, and
reached the Loir at Fréteval. A fight occurred at both
these points. Though the French had yielded thus far,
they seemed resolved to make a firm stand on the
Loir, and had occupied Cloyes and Vendôme in great
strength.</p>

<p>In order to attack with success, Prince Frederick
Charles first proceeded to concentrate all his forces.
The IIIrd Corps, which was hurrying after the army
by forced marches, was in the first instance to come
up into the interval between the Detachment and
the Xth Corps, which was to march from Blois and
Herbault on Vendôme.</p>

<p>But when, on the 15th, the Xth Corps was moving
in the prescribed direction, its main body encountered
so determined a resistance close in front of Vendôme
that it could not be overcome before dark. The troops
therefore retired to quarters in the rear of Ste. Anne.
A left-flank detachment had found St. Amand occupied
by heavy masses, and halted at Gombergean. The IIIrd
Corps had advanced in the course of the day on Coulommiers,
in the vicinity of Vendôme, had fought the French
at Bel Essert, driven them back across the Loir and
established connection with the Xth. The Grand Duke,
in compliance with instructions, stood meanwhile on
the defensive. The IXth Corps, after the restoration
of the bridge of Blois, was at last able to follow the
army, leaving a brigade in occupation of Blois.</p>

<p>A greatly superior force was now assembled opposite
the enemy's position, and a general attack was decided
on; but to give the wearied troops some rest it was
postponed till the 17th, and meanwhile, on the 16th,
General Chanzy withdrew.</p>

<p>It had certainly been his intention to make a longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
stand in the Loir angle; but his Generals convinced him
that the condition of the troops did not permit the prolongation
of active hostilities. He accordingly gave
the order for the retreat of the army at daybreak by
way of Montoire, St. Calais, and Vibraye to Le Mans.</p>

<p>Thus in the early morning (of the 17th) the Xth
Corps found the French position in front of Vendôme
abandoned, and it entered the city without opposition.
On the French left wing only, where the marching
orders had not yet arrived, General Jaurès made an
attack on Fréteval, but in the evening he followed the
other Corps.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Interruption of Important Offensive Operations
in December.</span></h2>


<p>On the 17th of December general directions were
issued from Versailles to the Armies both to the north
and south of Paris.</p>

<p>Now that General von Manteuffel was across the
Somme, and Prince Frederick Charles had advanced to
the Loir, the Germans held possession of almost a third
of France. The enemy was everywhere driven back;
and that the German forces should not be split up, it
was thought advisable that they should be concentrated
into three principal groups. The Ist Army was therefore
to assemble at Beauvais, the Detachment at
Chartres, the IInd Army near Orleans, where the troops
were to have the needful rest, and their full efficiency
was to be re-established by the arrival of reservists and
equipment. If the French should engage in any new
enterprises, they were to be allowed to approach within
striking distance, and then were to be driven back by a
vigorous offensive.</p>

<p>For the IInd Army there was but little prospect at
present of overtaking the enemy beyond the Loir; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the reports from the Upper Loire now necessitated the
bestowal of increased attention in that direction. News
came from Gien that the posts left there had been
driven back to Ouzouer sur Loire; and it seemed
not unlikely that General Bourbaki would take the
opportunity of advancing by Montargis towards Paris,
or at least towards Orleans, which for the moment was
occupied only by part of the Ist Bavarian Corps.</p>

<p>Prince Frederick Charles had got quit of his enemy
probably for some considerable time, and he decided, in
accordance with directions from Versailles, to assemble
his forces at Orleans and maintain a waiting attitude.
Only the Xth Corps was to remain behind in observation
on the Loir. To secure immediate support for the
Bavarian Corps in any event, the IXth Corps, on its
arrival from Blois at La Chapelle Vendômoise on the
16th December, was ordered to march to Beaugency
that same day, and to Orleans on the morrow. It
covered nearly 52 miles in twenty-four hours, notwithstanding
the badness of the weather. The IIIrd Corps
followed it.</p>

<p>However, it was soon known that the enemy's
detachment which had been seen at Gien did not form
part of a large body of troops, and was intrenching
itself at Briare for its own safety. So the Germans
retired into comfortable rest-quarters, the Ist Bavarian
Corps at Orleans, the IIIrd there and along to Beaugency,
the IXth in the plain of the Loire up as far as
Châteauneuf, with a strong post at Montargis.</p>

<p>The Bavarian Corps was later transferred to Etampes,
to recover at its leisure, to recruit its numbers, and refit
as to its clothing and equipment. Nor was the Grand
Duke of Mecklenburg's detachment in a condition to
follow General Chanzy beyond the Loir. Six weeks of
daily marching and fighting had tried the troops to the
utmost. The dreadful weather and the state of the
roads had reduced their clothing and foot-gear to a
miserable state. A reconnoissance beyond the Loir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
showed that the French could be overtaken by only
long and rapid marches. So the Grand Duke allowed
his troops a long rest, from the 18th, in the villages on
the left bank of the river.</p>

<p>Of the IIIrd Army, General von Rheinbaben, on the
other hand, occupied with the three Brigades of the
5th Cavalry Division Courtlain, Brou, and Chartres,
strengthened by five battalions of Guard Landwehr and
four batteries. A letter from the Chief of the General
Staff at Versailles had pointed out that this cavalry
might probably be employed with great success in
attacking the flank and rear of the enemy's retreating
columns, and the Crown Prince had already given
orders that it should push forward by way of Brou in
full strength on the 15th. Contrary to these orders,
the Division obeyed a subsequent order which reached
it on the 16th from the Grand Duke, under whose command
the Division had not been placed, to take up a
position on the Yères.</p>

<p>On this day patrols had found the roads open to
Montmirail and Mondoubleau, except for French
infantry in front of Cloyes, which retired after a short
fray. On the left, a connection was opened with the
4th Cavalry Division. On the 17th, the 12th Cavalry
Brigade entered Cloyes, already evacuated by the
French; on the 13th it advanced on Arrou, and only
General von Barby (commanding the 11th Cavalry
Brigade) marched on Droue with a force of all arms,
where he surprised the French at their cooking, and
carried off much booty.</p>

<p>On the 18th, the 12th Brigade did make prisoners of a
few stragglers there, but the other two brigades only
made a short march to the westward to La Bazoche Gouet
and Arville, whence the enemy had quite disappeared.
To the south of Arville a battalion of the Guard Landwehr
drove the French infantry out of St. Agil.</p>

<p>With this the pursuit ended on the 19th. The Division
retired on Nogent le Rotrou by the Grand Duke's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
desire, and subsequently undertook the observation of
the left bank of the Seine at Vernon and Dreux.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke's Detachment left its quarters on
the Loir on the 21st. The 22nd Division occupied
Nogent le Roi, and the 17th Chartres, till the 24th.
The 4th Bavarian Brigade rejoined its own Corps at
Orleans.</p>

<p>During the remainder of December only the Xth
Corps had any fighting, it having been detailed to keep
watch beyond the Loir from Blois and Vendôme.</p>

<p>Two brigades were set on march towards Tours on
the 20th. On the further side of Monnaie they met the
newly-formed troops of General Ferri-Pisani, 10,000 to
15,000 strong, which were advancing from Angers and
had passed through Tours.</p>

<p>The soaked ground made the deployment of the
artillery and cavalry exceedingly difficult. The
cavalry, indeed, could only pursue the retreating
French in deep columns along the high roads, thus
suffering severely from the enemy's fire delivered at
very short range.</p>

<p>On the following day General von Woyna (commanding
39th Infantry Brigade) advanced unopposed with
six battalions on the bridge at Tours. A light battery
was brought up on the bank of the river and dispersed
the rabble firing from the opposite shore, but it would
have cost too many lives to storm the city, which, since
the removal of the seat of Government, had ceased to
be of any great importance. The detachment was
withdrawn to Monnaie, and the Xth Corps went into
quarters, the 19th Division at Blois, the 20th at
Herbault and Vendôme.</p>

<p>From the latter place on the 27th, a detachment of
two battalions, one squadron, and two guns marched
through Montoire on Sougé on the Braye, and there
met a greatly superior force. General Chanzy had in
fact marched a Division of his XVIIth Corps towards
Vendôme in order to draw the Prussians away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Tours. Behind St. Quentin the weak Prussian detachment
found itself hemmed in between the river and the
cliff, enclosed on every side, and under heavy fire.
Lieutenant-Colonel von Boltenstern succeeded, however,
in cutting his way through. Without firing a
shot the two Hanoverian battalions hurled themselves
on the dense body of tirailleurs blocking their retreat,
and fought their way out fighting hand to hand.
Through the gap thus made the guns dashed after
firing one round of grape-shot, and notwithstanding
losses to the teams they ultimately got back safely to
Montoire. The squadron also charged through two lines
of riflemen and rejoined the infantry.</p>

<p>As a result of this incident General von Kraatz
Koschlau (commanding 20th Division) brought up
the remainder of his Division from Herbault, determined
to clear up the situation by a fresh reconnoissance.
Four battalions were to advance from
Vendôme, and the 1st Cavalry Brigade from Fréteval
was to scout towards Epuisay. On this same day, however,
General de Jouffroy was marching with two
Divisions to the attack of Vendôme.</p>

<p>When, at about ten o'clock, the reconnoitring force
from Vendôme reached the Azay, it came under a hot
fire from the further slope of the valley. Soon after
six hostile battalions attacked its flank from the south,
and repeated notice was brought in that considerable
forces of the enemy were marching on Vendôme direct,
from north of Azay by Espéreuse. General von Kraatz
perceived that he would have to face a planned attack
made by very superior numbers, and determined to
restrict himself to the local defence of Vendôme. Under
cover of a battalion firmly maintaining its position at
Huchepie, he accomplished in perfect order the retreat
of the detachment, which then took up a position on the
railway embankment to the west of the city.</p>

<p>Further to the north the hostile columns, advancing
over Espéreuse, had already reached Bel Air. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
battalion hastening up from Vendôme re-occupied the
château, but being outflanked on the right by a superior
force withdrew, and likewise took up a position behind
the railway. At about two o'clock the French attacked
this position in dense swarms of sharpshooters, but came
under the quick-fire of six batteries in position on the
heights behind Vendôme, which caused their right
wing to give way. A column of the enemy advanced
along the left bank of the Loir from Varennes against
this artillery position, but hastily retreated out of range
of the fire from it.</p>

<p>The attacks directed against the railway from Bel Air
and Tuileries were more serious; but eight companies
posted there repelled them. At four o'clock the French
once more advanced in strength; fortune wavered for
some time, and at length, as darkness fell, they retired.</p>

<p>The 1st Cavalry Brigade, accompanied by two companies
and a horse battery, marched on this day on
Danzé. Captain Spitz, with a handful of his Westphalian
Fusiliers fell on two batteries halted there, and
captured two guns and three limbers. With these and
fifty prisoners General von Lüderitz (commanding 1st
Cavalry Brigade) returned to Fréteval by about one
o'clock, after pursuing the enemy as far as Epuisay.</p>

<p>The attempt of the French on Vendôme had utterly
failed, and they now retreated to a greater distance.
General von Kraatz, however, was ordered, in the prospect
of a greater enterprise to be described later, to
remain meanwhile in waiting on the Loir.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The XIVth Corps in December.</span></h2>


<p>In the south-eastern theatre of war the French had
at last decided on some definite action.</p>

<p>Garibaldi's Corps, assembled at Autun, advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
toward Dijon on the 24th (November); its detachments
closed up by Sombernon and St. Seine, with various
skirmishes, and subjected to night surprises. Crémer's
Division advanced as far as Gevrey from the south.
But as soon as reinforcements reached Dijon from Gray
and Is sur Tille, the enemy was driven back, and now
General von Werder on his part ordered the 1st
Brigade of his Corps to march on Autun. General
Keller (commanding 3rd Infantry Brigade, Baden
Division), arrived in front of the town on December 1st,
driving the hostile detachments before him. The preparations
had been made to attack on the following day,
when orders came for a rapid retreat. Fresh troops had
become necessary at Châtillon, to replace the posts which
had been stationed to protect the railway and which
had been surprised at Gray, to cope with sorties by the
garrison of Besançon and also to observe Langres.</p>

<p>The Prussian Brigade (26th) marched on Langres, along
with two cavalry regiments and three batteries, and on
the 16th it met the French in the vicinity of Longeau,
in number about 2000. They were repulsed, losing
200 wounded, fifty prisoners, two guns, and two ammunition
waggons. General von der Goltz (commanding
the Brigade) in the next few days surrounded
Langres, drove the Gardes-Mobiles posted outside into
the fortress, and occupied a position opposite the
northern front for the protection of the railways.</p>

<p>In the country south of Dijon fresh assemblages of
French troops had also now been observed. To disperse
these General von Werder advanced on the 18th with
two Baden Brigades on Nuits. In Boncourt, close to the
town on the east, the advanced guard met with lively
opposition, but carried the place by noon. The French,
aided by their batteries posted on the heights west of
Nuits, offered an obstinate defence in the deep railway
cutting and at the Meuzin brook. When the main body
of the Brigade came up at two o'clock, General von
Glümer (commanding Baden Division) ordered a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
attack. With heavy losses, especially in superior officers,
the infantry now rushed across the open plain at the
double against the enemy, who was under cover, and
who, after maintaining a fire at short range, was driven
back on Nuits so late as four o'clock in the course of a
hand-to-hand struggle. At five o'clock he abandoned
the place before the on-coming battalions.</p>

<p>The Germans had had to do with Crémer's Division,
10,000 strong, which lost 1700 men, among them 650
unwounded prisoners. The Baden Division had lost
900 men. It encamped for the night on the market-place
of the town and in the villages to the eastward.
Next morning the French were found to have retreated
still further, but the Germans were not strong enough
for pursuit. The XIVth Corps had already been
obliged to spare seven battalions for the investment of
Belfort. General von Werder therefore returned to
Dijon, where he assembled all the forces still left to
him with those of General von der Goltz from Langres,
and waited to see whether the enemy would again
advance against him. But the month of December
ended without any further disturbance.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">The Ist Army in December.</span></h2>


<p>While the IInd Army was fighting on the Loire,
General von Manteuffel, after the victory of Amiens,
marched on Rouen.</p>

<p>General Farre was indeed at Arras, in the rear of
this movement, but the disorder in which his troops
had retired after the battle made it probable that he
would do nothing, at any rate for the present. The
3rd Brigade, too, was left in Amiens, with two cavalry
regiments and three batteries, to occupy the place and
protect the important line of railway to Laon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The outlook to the west was more serious than to the
north, for from thence at this juncture hostile forces
threatened to interfere with the investment of Paris.
General Briand was at Rouen with some 20,000 men,
and had advanced his leading troops up to the Epte,
where at Beauvais and Gisors he came in contact with
the Guard Dragoon regiment and the Saxon Cavalry
Division detached from the Army of the Meuse. The
detachment of infantry which accompanied the latter
had lost 150 men and a gun in a night surprise.</p>

<p>When the Ist Army reached the Epte on December
3rd, both bodies of cavalry joined its further march,
and the French retired behind the Andelles. The
VIIIth Corps reached the vicinity of Rouen after petty
skirmishes by the way, and found an intrenched position
abandoned at Isneauville; and on December 5th
General von Goeben entered the chief city of Normandy.
The 29th Brigade advanced on Pont Audemer,
the Ist Corps crossed the Seine higher up at Les Andelys
and Pont de l'Arche. Vernon and Evreux were occupied,
whence numbers of Gardes-Mobiles had retreated
by railway to Liseux. On the northern bank the Guard
Dragoon Regiment reconnoitred as far as Bolbec, and
the Uhlan Brigade found no enemy in Dieppe.</p>

<p>The French had retired to Havre, and a considerable
force had been conveyed in ships that were in readiness,
to Honfleur on the other bank of the Seine. The 16th
Division continued its march on Havre, reaching Bolbec
and Lillebonne on the 11th.</p>

<p>The already-mentioned directions from Versailles had
been communicated in advance by the Chief of the
General Staff, and in accordance with them General
Manteuffel now decided on leaving only the Ist Corps
on the Lower Seine, and returning with the VIIIth to
the Somme, where the French in Arras were now becoming
active.</p>

<p>Besides making this evident by various small encounters,
on December 9th they had attacked a company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
detailed to protect the reconstruction of the railway at
Ham, surprising it at night, and taking most of the men
prisoners; while on the 11th several French battalions
advanced as far as La Fère.</p>

<p>To check their further progress, the Army of the
Meuse had meantime sent detachments to Soissons and
Compiègne. General Count von der Groeben<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> (commanding
3rd Cavalry Division) took up a position at
Roye with part of the garrison of Amiens, and on
the 16th met the 15th Division at Montdidier, which
immediately moved up to the Somme.</p>

<p>Only the citadel of Amiens now remained in German
occupation; but General von Manteuffel, who had not
approved of the evacuation of the city, ordered its immediate
reoccupation. The inhabitants had, however,
remained peaceable, and on the 20th the 16th Division,
which had given up the attack on Havre, arrived by
way of Dieppe.</p>

<p>A reconnoissance fight near Querrieux made it certain
that great numbers of French were drawn up on
the Hallue, and General von Manteuffel now drew in
the whole (VIIIth) Corps on Amiens. Reinforcements
were shortly to be expected, for the 3rd Reserve Division
was on the march, and had already reached St. Quentin.
The Ist Corps was also ordered to send a brigade from
Rouen to Amiens by railway, and the Commanding
General determined to take the offensive at once with
22,600 men, all his available force at the moment.</p>

<p>General Faidherbe had assembled two Corps, the
XXIInd and XXIIIrd. His advance on Ham and La
Fère, intended to divert the Prussians from attacking
Havre, had succeeded. He next turned toward Amiens,
advanced to within nine miles of the city, and now
stood, with 43,000 men and eighty-two guns, fronting
to the west behind the Hallue. Two Divisions held
the left bank of this stream for about seven miles, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
its confluence at Daours up to Contay, two standing
further back, at Corbie and Fravillers. The Somme
secured the left flank.</p>

<p>On December 23rd General von Manteuffel, with the
VIIIth Corps, advanced on the road to Albert. The
3rd Brigade of the Ist Corps formed his reserve. His
design was to keep the French engaged by the 15th
Division on their front and left wing, and with the 16th
Division to outflank their right. The unexpected extension
of the French right wing prevented this, and it
became a frontal battle along the whole line. The
greater height of the eastern bank afforded the French
a commanding artillery position, and the villages lying
at the foot had in every instance to be stormed.</p>

<p>The French had drawn in their advanced posts to this
line when at eleven o'clock the head of the 15th Division
reached the grove of Querrieux, and brought up a
battery. Two battalions of the 29th Brigade took the
village at mid-day at the first onslaught, crossed the
stream, and drove the French on the further bank out
of Noyelles; but they now found themselves overwhelmed
by an artillery and infantry fire from all sides.
The East Prussians<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> stormed the acclivity at about four
o'clock, and took two guns which were in action, but
were forced to fall back into the village before the
advancing French masses.</p>

<p>Soon after mid-day Féchencourt was won on the left,
and Bussy on the right; and the enemy after a feeble
resistance was driven back across the stream. On the
other hand, the German Artillery could at first do
nothing against the strong and well-posted batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of the enemy. Vecquemont, however, was stormed,
though stoutly defended, and a bitter street-fight lasted
till the afternoon.</p>

<p>The 15th Division, against the intention of General
Manteuffel, had become involved in fighting before the
16th, engaged further to the left, could afford it any
assistance. Not till four o'clock did the 31st Brigade
arrive in front of Béhencourt, when, crossing the river
by flying bridges, it threw the enemy back into the
village, where he maintained a stout resistance, but had
ultimately to give way. The 32nd Brigade, on the
extreme left, crossed the Hallue and entered Bavelincourt.</p>

<p>Thus all the hamlets on the river were in German
possession; but the short December day was closing in,
and further progress had to be postponed till the
morrow. Even in the dark the French made several
attempts to recover the positions they had lost, especially
about Contay, where they outflanked the German
position. But their attacks were repulsed both there
and at Noyelles. They succeeded, indeed, in getting
into Vecquemont, but were driven out again, and
were lost to the Prussians now following across the
stream, who even seized Daours, so that ultimately
the Germans held dominion over every passage of
the Hallue.</p>

<p>The battle was over by six o'clock. The troops
moved into alarm-quarters in the captured villages,
their foreposts standing close in front of the outlets.</p>

<p>The attack had cost the Germans 900 men; the defence
had cost the French about 1000, besides 1000
unwounded prisoners who were taken into Amiens.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the 24th the French opened fire on
General Manteuffel's position in the angle bounded by
the Hallue and the Somme.</p>

<p>It having been ascertained that the enemy's strength
was almost double that of the Germans, it was decided
this day on the latter side to remain on the defensive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
pending the arrival of reinforcements, and to strengthen
the defence of the positions gained. The Army-Reserve
was pushed forward to Corbie to threaten the left flank
of the French.</p>

<p>But at two o'clock in the afternoon General Faidherbe
took up his retreat. His insufficiently-equipped
troops had suffered fearfully through the bitter winter
night, and were much shaken by the unfavourable issue
of the fighting of the previous day. He therefore drew
them back within the area of the covering fortresses.
When on the 25th the two Prussian Divisions and the
cavalry pursued beyond Albert, and then close up to
Arras and as far as Cambrai, they found no formed
bodies at all in front of those places, and only captured
some hundreds of stragglers.</p>

<p>When General Manteuffel had thus disposed of the
enemy, he sent General von Mirus (commanding 6th
Cavalry Brigade) to invest Péronne, while he himself
returned to Rouen.</p>

<p>Since it had detached to Amiens six battalions as a
reinforcement, the Ist Army Corps (at Rouen) now remained
only two brigades strong. The French had
10,000 men on the right bank, and 12,000 on the left
bank of the lower Seine. And these forces had come
very close to Rouen; particularly on the south side
within nine miles. Meanwhile, however, the Commanding-General
had ordered back the 2nd Brigade
from Amiens, and on its arrival the hostile bodies
were once more driven back.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Reduction of Mézières.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(1st January, 1871.)</div>


<p>In the northern section of hostilities, before the end
of the year, the siege of Mézières was brought to an
end. After the battle of Sedan the Commandant had
contributed supplies from the magazines of the fortress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
for the maintenance of the great mass of prisoners, and
it had remained, therefore, for the time exempt from
attack. Later the place precluded the use of the railroad;
still it was only kept under provisional observation
till the 19th of December, when, after the fall
of Montmédy, the 14th Division moved up before
Mézières.</p>

<p>The garrison numbered only 2000 men, but it was
effectively assisted by bands of volunteers outside, who
displayed extraordinary activity in this broken and
wooded country. The place was not completely invested
till the 25th.</p>

<p>Mézières stands on a mountain-spur which is surrounded
on three sides by the Moselle,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> but it is hemmed
by a ring of heights. The character of the defences,
which had been strengthened by Vauban, with their
numerous salient angles, was not calculated to resist
modern long-range artillery. The place exposed an
isolated rampart of masonry in a circumference of
from 2160 to 3250 yards, and although the long
delay had been utilized in repairing the weak points by
throwing up earthworks, a bombardment could not fail
to be destructive to the defenders.</p>

<p>When Verdun had surrendered, heavy siege guns
were brought by rail from Clermont to a position close
in front of the southern face of the fortress. The only
hindrance to the erection of the batteries was the state
of the soil, frozen to a depth of twenty inches; and at
a quarter past eight on the morning of the 31st of
December 68 siege guns and 8 field-pieces opened fire.
At first the fortress replied vigorously, but by the afternoon
its artillery was utterly silenced, and the white
flag was hoisted next day. The garrison were taken
prisoners; considerable stores and 132 guns fell into
the hands of the besiegers. But the chief advantage
gained was the opening of a new line of railway to
Paris.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Paris in December.</span></h2>


<p>In Paris General Ducrot had been busily employed
in making good the losses sustained in the battle of
Villiers. A part of the greatly reduced Ist Corps had
to be consigned to the reserve; the IInd Army was reorganized.
A projected sortie by way of the peninsula
of Gennevillers and the heights of Franconville
had not been approved by the government. There was
the confident expectation of seeing the Army of Orleans
appear within a short time before the capital, and steps
were being taken to reach it the hand, when on
the 6th December a letter from General von Moltke
announced the defeat of General d'Aurelle and the
occupation of Orleans. A sortie to the south would
thenceforth be aimless, and after long deliberation it
was at length decided to break through the enemy's
lines in a northern direction by a sortie in great
force.</p>

<p>It was true that the Morée brook afforded the besiegers
some cover on that side, but only so long as the ice
would not bear. And there were but three German
corps of the gross strength of 81,200, extended over a
front of about twenty-seven miles.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>By way of preparation earthworks were begun to be
thrown up on the 13th, between Bondy and Courneuve,
the forts of the north front were furnished with a
heavier artillery equipment, and the plateau of Mont
Avron was occupied by batteries. Ninety rounds of
ammunition were served out to each man, with six
days' rations; and four days' fodder for the horses.
Packs were not to be carried, but rolled tent-pieces
were to be worn as breast-protection. December 19th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
was the day first set for the enterprise, but there
was a postponement to the 21st.</p>

<p>Thus, during the larger half of December the investing
army had remained almost wholly undisturbed
by the defenders. Regular food, warm winter clothing,
and abundant supplies of comforts which the exertions
of the postal service afforded, had maintained the troops
in a thoroughly satisfactory condition.</p>

<p>The preparations which the garrison was making for
a new effort did not escape the notice of the besieging
forces. Deserters brought in reports of an imminent
sortie. On the 20th information came from the posts
of observation that large masses of troops were assembling
about Merlan and Noisy le Sec; and early on the
21st the 2nd Guard Division, by order of the Commander-in-Chief
of the Army of the Meuse, stood in
readiness at the passages of the Morée. Part of the 1st
Division remained in reserve at Gonesse; the other
portion was to be relieved by the 7th Division, and
made available for action. On the right wing the
Guard Landwehr Division occupied the section from
Chatou to Carrières St. Denis; on the left a brigade
of the Saxon Corps held Sévran. The 4th Infantry
Division of the IInd Corps moved to Malnoue to
support, in case of need, the Würtembergers, to whom
was allotted the task of holding resolutely the advanced
position of Joinville opposite the French.</p>

<p>To divert the attention of the Germans from the
true point of attack, a brisk fire was to be opened in
early morning from Fort Valérien; strong bodies were
to assail the right wing of the Guard Corps, General
Vinoy was to lead the IIIrd Army against the Saxons,
and Admiral de la Roncière was to fall upon Le
Bourget with his Army Corps. This latter post, projecting
as it did so prominently, it was essential to
seize first of all, and not till then was General Ducrot,
with the IInd Paris Army, to cross the Morée near
Blanc Mesnil and Aulnay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Combat of le Bourget, 21st December.</span>)&mdash;Le
Bourget was held by only four companies of the
Queen Elizabeth Regiment, and one Guard Rifle
battalion. When the mist rose at a quarter to eight,
there was rained on the garrison a heavy fire from the
guns of the forts and many batteries, as well as from
armour-clad railway trucks. Half an hour later closed
hostile columns marched on the place from east and
west. In the former direction its outskirts were successfully
defended for some time against seven French
battalions, and on the opposite side five more were
brought to a halt by the quick fire of the defenders in
front of the cemetery<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>; but a detachment of marine
fusiliers penetrated unhindered into the village by its
northern entrance. Pressed upon on all sides by overwhelming
numbers, the defenders were compelled to
fall back into the southern part of the village. The
garrison of the cemetery also strove to force its way
thither, but part of it fell into the enemy's hands.
The French advanced only step by step, suffering
heavy loss in bloody street-fighting, but they did not
succeed in obtaining possession of the buildings or glass-factory.
Five fresh battalions of the French reserve
marched up from St. Denis on the gas-works, and
battered down the garden-wall with cannon-fire, but
still could not crush there the steady resistance of the
Germans.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock the latter were reinforced by one
company, and at ten o'clock by seven more companies,
which in a bloody hand-to-hand struggle, fought their
way to the cemetery and glass-factory. By eleven the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
last bodies of assailants were driven out, and Le
Bourget, in expectation of a renewed attack, was occupied
by fifteen companies. Two batteries of field
artillery, which had been in brisk action on the Morée,
were brought up to the village.</p>

<p>General Ducrot had meanwhile waited in vain for the
signal which was to have announced the capture of Le
Bourget. He had pushed forward the heads of his
columns beyond Bondy and Drancy, when he was
warned by the disastrous issue of the struggle on his
left to abandon his intended attack on the line of the
Morée.</p>

<p>The anticipated important enterprise lapsed into a
mere cannonade, to which the German field-guns did
their best to reply. In the afternoon the French retired
from the field.</p>

<p>They had lost, by their own account, about 600 men.
The troops of the Prussian Guard Corps lost 400, but
360 prisoners remained in their hands. In the evening
the outposts resumed their previous positions.</p>

<p>The various feigned attacks of the Parisian garrison
were without effect, and produced no alteration in the
dispositions made on the German side. An advance
from St. Denis against Stains was repulsed, and two
gunboats on the Seine had to go about in consequence
of the fire of four field batteries on Orgemont. The
trivial sortie on Chatou was scarcely heeded. General
Vinoy indeed led forward a large force along the right
bank of the Marne, but that was not till the afternoon,
when the fight at Le Bourget was over. The Saxon
outposts retired into the fighting position near Le
Chenay. One of the battalions massed there drove
the enemy out of Maison Blanche that same evening,
another made a grasp at Ville Evrart, where fighting
went on till midnight; it lost seventy men, but brought
in 600 prisoners. Next morning the French abandoned
Ville Evrart, under heavy fire from the German artillery
on the heights on the opposite side of the river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Paris had now been invested for three months. The
always distasteful expedient of a bombardment of a
place so extensive could not of itself bring about a
decisive result; and on the German side there was the
full conviction that only a regular siege could accomplish
the wished-for end. But the operations of the
engineers had to be delayed till the artillery should
be in a position to co-operate with them.</p>

<p>It has already been shown that the siege-artillery
had been first employed against those fortified places
which interrupted the rearward communications of the
army. There were indeed 235 heavy pieces standing
ready at Villacoublay; but it had proved impossible as
yet to bring up the necessary ammunition for the attack
which, once begun, must on no account be interrupted.</p>

<p>By the end of November, railway communication
had been restored up to Chelles, but the greater part of
the ammunition had meanwhile been deposited at
Lagny, and from thence would now have to be carried
forward by the country roads. The ordinary two-wheeled
country carts proved totally unfit for the
transport of shells, and only 2000 four-wheeled waggons
had been collected by requisitions made over a wide
area. There were brought up from Metz 960 more
with horses sent from Germany, and even the teams of
the IIIrd Army were taken into the service, though
they were almost indispensable just then to contribute
towards the efficiency of the army fighting on the
Loire. Finally, all the draught horses of the pontoon
columns, of the field-bridge trains, and of the trench-tool
columns were brought into the ammunition-transport
service. A new difficulty arose when the breaking-up
of the ice necessitated the removal of the
pontoon bridges over the Seine. The roads were so
bad that it took the waggons nine days to get from
Nanteuil to Villacoublay and back. Many broke
down under their loads, and the drivers constantly
took to flight. And moreover, at the instance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Chief of the Staff there was now laid upon the artillery
yet an additional task to be carried out forthwith.</p>

<p>Though the besieged had not hitherto succeeded in
forcing their way through the enemy's lines, they now
set about widening their elbow room, with intent that
by their counter-approaches the ring of investment
should be further and yet further pushed back, until
at last it should reach the breaking point. On the
south side the French entrenchments already extended
beyond Vitry and Villejuif to the Seine; and on the
north, between Drancy and Fort de l'Est, there was an
extensive system of trenches and batteries reaching to
within 1100 yards of Le Bourget, which in part might
in a manner be dignified with the title of a regular
engineer-attack. The hard frost had indeed hindered
the further progress of these works, but they were
armed with artillery and occupied by the IInd Army.
And further, a singularly favourable point of support for
a sortie to the east as well as to the north, was afforded
to the French in the commanding eminence of Mont
Avron, which, armed with seventy heavy guns, projected
into the Marne valley like a wedge between the
northern and southern investing lines.</p>


<p>(<span class="smcap">Bombardment of Mont Avron, December 27th.</span>)&mdash;In
order to expel the French from this position fifty
heavy guns from Germany, and twenty-six from before
La Fère were brought up under the command of
Colonel Bartsch. By the exertions of a whole battalion
as a working party, two groups of battery emplacements
were erected in spite of the severe frost on the
western slope of the heights behind Raincy and Gagny,
and on the left upland of the Marne Valley near Noisy
le Grand, thus encompassing Mont Avron on two sides
at a distance of from 2160 to 3250 feet.</p>

<p>At half-past eight on the morning of 27th December
those seventy-six guns opened fire. A heavy snowstorm
interfered with accurate aim, and prevented any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
observation of the execution done. Mont Avron and
Forts Nogent and Rosny replied rapidly and heavily.</p>

<p>The German batteries lost two officers and twenty-five
gunners, several gun-carriages broke down under
their own fire, and everything pointed to the prospect
that no definite result would be obtained on that
day.</p>

<p>But the batteries had fired more effectually than had
been supposed. The clear weather of the 28th allowed
of greater precision; the Prussian fire proved most
telling, making fearful havoc in the numerous and
exposed French infantry garrison. Mont Avron was
silenced, and only the forts kept up a feeble fire.
General Trochu, who was present in person, ordered
the abandonment of the position, which was so effectually
accomplished in the night by the energetic
commander, Colonel Stoffel, that only one disabled
gun was left behind.</p>

<p>On the 29th the French fire was silent, and the hill
was found deserted. The Germans had no intention of
continuing to occupy the position. Their batteries
now turned their fire on the forts, which suffered
severely, and on the earthworks near Bondy.</p>

<p>By the end of the year the besiegers had succeeded
in collecting the most indispensable ammunition in
Villacoublay. The engineer operations were entrusted
to General Kameke; the artillery was under the command
of General Prince Hohenlohe.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The battery
emplacements had long been finished, and with
the dawn of the new year 100 guns of the largest
calibres stood ready to open fire on the south front of
Paris.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Army of the East under General Bourbaki.</span></h2>


<p>While the French forces were engaged in constant
fighting, in the north on the Seine and the Somme, in
the south on the Loire and the Saône, General Bourbaki's
army had nowhere made itself prominent. Since
the 8th of December, when the 6th Cavalry Division
had reported its presence at Vierzon, all trace of it had
been lost. It was of course of the greatest importance to
the supreme Command that it should know the whereabouts
of so large an army; only the IInd German
Army could acquire this information, and on the 22nd
it received instructions to obtain the required enlightenment
by means of reconnaissances.</p>

<p>On this errand General von Rantzau (commanding
25th Cavalry Brigade) set out from Montargis by the
right bank of the Loire towards Briare, where he found
that the French had abandoned their position on the
25th; in the course of the next few days he met them,
and was defeated.</p>

<p>The Hessian detachment was reinforced to a strength
of three battalions, four squadrons and six guns, but
was nevertheless driven back to Gien on the 1st of
January. The French had displayed a force of several
thousand Gardes-Mobiles, twelve guns, and a body of
marine infantry. A noticeable fact was that some of
the prisoners brought in belonged to the XVIIIth
French Corps, which formed part of the Ist Army of
the Loire.</p>

<p>A regiment of the 6th Cavalry Division sent out to
reconnoitre into the Sologne, returned with the report
that strong hostile columns were marching on Aubigny
Ville. On the other hand, two waggon-drivers who had
been taken prisoners declared that the French troops had
been already moved from Bourges by rail, and the newspaper
reports also pointed to the same conclusion; still,
too much weight could not be attached to mere rumour
as against circumstantial intelligence. It was therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
assumed at Versailles that the Ist Army of the Loire
was still about Bourges, and that General Bourbaki,
when again in a condition to fight, would act in
concert with General Chanzy.</p>

<p>The two armies might attack the Germans at Orleans
from opposite sides, or one might engage and detain
them there, while the other marched to relieve the
capital.</p>

<p>This, in fact, was what General Chanzy had in view.
Since the 21st of December he had been resting in
quarters in and about Le Mans, where railways from
four directions facilitated the bringing up of new levies.
His troops had no doubt great hardships to contend
with there. In lack of shelter for such great masses
part had to camp out under canvas in the snow, and
suffered severely from the intense cold. The hospitals
were crammed with wounded and small-pox patients.
On the other hand, this close concentration was
favourable to the reorganization of the details and the
restoration of discipline; and the news from Paris
urged the General to renewed action.</p>

<p>General Trochu had sent word that Paris unaided
could not accomplish her freedom. Even if a sortie
should prove successful, the necessary supplies for the
maintenance of an army could not be carried with it,
and therefore nothing but the simultaneous appearance
of an army from without could meet the case. Now
General Chanzy was quite ready to march on Paris,
but it was indispensable that he should first know
exactly what Generals Bourbaki and Faidherbe were
doing.</p>

<p>It was clearly evident that concerted action on the
part of three great Army Corps could only be devised
and controlled by the chief power. The General therefore
sent an officer of his Staff on the 23rd of December
to Gambetta at Lyons, to express his conviction that
only a combined and prompt advance could avert the
fall of the capital. But the Minister believed that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
knew better. The first news of a quite different disposition
of Bourbaki's army only reached General
Chanzy on the 29th, when it was already entered upon.
Nor in other respects did Gambetta's reply convey
either distinct orders or sufficient information. "You
have decimated the Mecklenburgers," wrote Gambetta,
"the Bavarians no longer exist, the rest of the German
Army is a prey to disquietude and exhaustion. Let
us persevere, and we shall drive these hordes from our
soil with empty hands." The plan of the Provisional
Government was to be the one "which would most
demoralize the German army."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Under instructions so obscure from the chief authority
General Chanzy, relying on his own strength,
determined to make his way to Paris without other
assistance; but he soon found himself in serious
difficulties.</p>

<p>On the German side there was no time to be lost in
utilizing their position between the two hostile armies,
advantageous as it was so long as those armies were
not too near. The simultaneous attacks on the 31st
December at Vendôme on the Loir, and at Briare on
the Loire, seemed to indicate that the two were already
acting on a concerted plan.</p>

<p>On New Year's day Prince Frederick Charles received
telegraphic instructions to re-cross the Loir without
delay, and strike at General Chanzy, as being the
nearest and most imminently dangerous enemy. With
this object the IInd Army was strengthened by the
addition of the XIIIth Corps of the Grand Duke of
Mecklenburg (17th and 22nd Divisions) and the 2nd
and 4th Divisions of Cavalry. And in addition the
5th Cavalry Division was detailed to the duty of
covering the right flank of the advance.</p>

<p>Only the 25th (Hessian) Division was to be left in
Orleans as a possible check on General Bourbaki,
and to maintain observation on Gien. But as a further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
provision, in case of need against a possible advance
of the IInd Army of the Loire, General von Zastrow
was ordered to the Armançon with the VIIth Corps;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
and further the IInd Corps from the besieging lines
was set in march to Montargis.</p>

<p>Prince Frederick Charles' arrangement was to have
his three corps assembled on the line Vendôme&mdash;Morée
by 6th January, and to order the XIIIth from Chartres
on Brou.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Advance of the IInd Army to Le Mans.</span></h2>


<p>The Germans had hoped to strike the enemy in his
winter quarters; but General Chanzy had provided
against surprise by a cordon of strong advanced positions.
Nogent le Rotrou on his left was held by Rousseau's
Division, and numerous bands of volunteers;
from thence strong detachments were posted through
Vibraye and St. Calais up to the Braye brook, where
General Jouffroy had made a halt after the last attack
on Vendôme; and on the right were General Barry at La
Chartre and de Curten's Division at Château Renault.</p>

<p>Both wings of the German army came into collision
with these forces on the 5th of January.</p>

<p>General Baumgarth (commanding 2nd Cavalry
Brigade), on the German left, had assembled at St.
Amand three battalions, two cavalry regiments and
two batteries. The 57th regiment stormed Villeporcher
in the direction of Château Renault, evacuated it in
face of an attack by four French battalions, and finally
recaptured and held it. This much, at any rate, was
thus ascertained, that a not inconsiderable force of the
enemy was assembled in front of the left wing of the
German army now marching westward. While this
movement was in prosecution General Baumgarth was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
thenceforth to undertake its protection, and with this
object he was reinforced by the addition of the 6th
Cavalry Division and the 1st Cavalry Brigade.</p>

<p>On the right wing the 44th Brigade, in its advance
on Nogent le Rotrou, also had had a sharp encounter.
It carried the enemy's position at La Fourche, and
captured three guns, with a large number of prisoners.
The main body of the Corps (the XIIIth) reached
Beaumont les Autels and Brou, but the cavalry failed
to penetrate the woods to the north of Nogent.</p>

<p><i>January 6th.</i>&mdash;At six in the morning the advanced
guard of General Baumgarth's detachment started on
march to Prunay, but the main body could not follow,
since it was attacked in force at about half-past nine.
With the object of observing the enemy, the infantry
had been scattered in detached posts in a wide extension
from Ambloy to Villeporcher, and only a small
reserve remained at La Noue. The fight soon assumed
greater expansion, and the defence with difficulty maintained
the line Les Haies&mdash;Pias, the turning of the
German left flank being seriously threatened, upon
which the 6th Cavalry Division moved up, but could
only enter the fight with one horse battery. The
reserve, however, moved up along the high road to
Château Renault and repulsed the enemy, who had
already forced his way into Les Haies. But when
he renewed the attack in strong columns and developed
four batteries against the place, the reserve was obliged
to retire behind the Brenne.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 16th Regiment, which had already
reached Ambloy on its march to Vendôme, turned
back to St. Amand in support, and the just assembled
38th Infantry Brigade deployed between Neuve St.
Amand and St. Amand with a strong force of cavalry
on its flanks. But as by some mistake St. Amand was
evacuated, Duke William of Mecklenburg (commanding
6th Cavalry Division) ordered a further retreat.
The infantry, however, had already come to a halt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Huisseau and took quarters there. The advanced
guard turned into Ambloy; the cavalry fell back
partly on that place and partly on Villeromain.</p>

<p>During the engagement about St. Amand the Xth
Corps itself advanced on Montoire in two columns
along the left bank of the Loire, leaving on its right a
battalion in front of Vendôme to secure the debouche
of the IIIrd Corps through that place.</p>

<p>When the 20th Division reached St. Rimay at
about one o'clock, it found the heights on the opposite
side of the Loir occupied by General Barry's troops.
The massed German batteries were brought up to the
southern ridge of the valley and soon drove the French
off the broad flats; but the defile of Les Roches in the
front remained quite unassailable. The broken bridge
at Lavardin, lower down the stream, was therefore
made practicable by the pioneers. The 19th Division
having meanwhile reached that place, several battalions
crossed from the south side to attack Les
Roches, and easily dislodged the French. As darkness
came on, preventing any further advance, the Corps
found quarters in and about Montoire.</p>

<p>The Commander of the IIIrd Corps had intended to
make a halt on this day before Vendôme, and only push
forward his advanced guard as far as the Azay brook;
but this detachment soon met with so stout opposition,
that the main force was compelled to advance to its
assistance. General de Jouffroy, with intent to disengage
General de Curten, had renewed the attack on
Vendôme, and so the advanced guard of the 5th Division,
approaching Villiers at about half-past one, found
the 10th Jäger Battalion, which had accompanied the
march of its Corps along the right bank of the Loir,
engaged at that place in a sharp fight which had
already lasted four hours. The advanced guard
brought up its two batteries on to the plateau north of
the village, and the 48th Regiment made its way
forward to the slope of the lower Azay valley, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
broad flat meadows of which were commanded by the
French long-range rifles and completely swept by the
fire of the artillery. And here then the enemy came
over to the attack in dense swarms of sharp-shooters.</p>

<p>The 8th Regiment presently came up in support,
and after a short fight took possession of Le Gué du
Loir on its left flank; then the further reinforcement
arrived of the 10th Infantry Brigade, and by degrees
the number of Prussian guns increased to thirty-six.
The French artillery could not endure their fire, and
within half an hour it was possible to turn it on the
hostile infantry. At about half-past four the German
battalions crossed the valley, made themselves masters
of the vineyards and farms on the opposite heights, and
finally stormed Mazange. Under cover of the darkness
the French retired to Lunay.</p>

<p>Further to the right the advance guard of the 6th
Division, having left Vendôme at eleven o'clock, found
the battalion left by the Xth Corps at Courtiras fighting
hard against a very superior force of the French.
The 11th Brigade advanced on the Azay ravine,
though not without heavy loss, and when at about
half-past three the 12th also came up, and the artillery
went to work vigorously, Azay was successfully stormed
and the force established itself firmly on the heights
beyond. Repeated counterstrokes of the enemy were
repulsed in succession, and by five o'clock the fighting
ended with the retirement of the French.</p>

<p>The IIIrd Army Corps took up quarters between
the Azay stream and the Loir. A detachment
occupied Danzé, higher up the river. The Corps lost
thirty-nine officers and above 400 men, but captured
400 prisoners.</p>

<p>In the course of the day the IXth Corps crossed
the upper Loir about Fréteval and St. Hilaire, without
opposition, and advanced along the high road to St.
Calais, as far as Busloup. The XIIIth remained at
Unverre, Beaumont, and La Fourche.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Frederick Charles had not been led into any
change of purpose by the attack at St. Amand and the
obstinate resistance at Azay. The XIIIth Corps was
expected to reach Montmirail, and the XIth Epuisay,
both on the 7th; the IIIrd was to continue the attack
on the deep-cut channel of the Braye brook. But after
the reverse experienced at St. Amand, the presence of a
strong hostile force on the left flank could not be suffered
to remain unregarded. Duke William had already been
given verbal orders at the Head-quarter in Vendôme,
to turn back forthwith to St. Amand with the 6th
Cavalry Division, and in addition General von Voigts-Rhetz
was ordered to support General Baumgarth if
necessary with his whole Corps.</p>

<p>The country between the Loir and the Sarthe
through which the Germans had to march, presents
peculiar difficulties to an invading force, and affords
marked advantages to the defence.</p>

<p>All the roads leading to Le Mans intersect at right
angles, stream after stream flowing through broad and
deeply cut meadow-valleys. Groves, villages, and
châteaux with walled parks cover the highly cultivated
upland; vineyards, orchards and gardens are enclosed
by hedges, ditches or fences.</p>

<p>Hence almost the whole burthen of the impending
fighting would have to be borne by the infantry;
nowhere was there space for the deployment of cavalry,
and the use of artillery needs must be extremely
limited, since in a country so greatly enclosed guns
could only singly be brought into action. The enemy's
central position could be approached by only four main
roads, and the communications between the marching
columns, starting at the least some thirty miles apart,
would be confined to the cross roads, almost impassable
from the severity of the season and the hostility of the
inhabitants. Any lateral mutual support was at first
quite out of the question.</p>

<p>Under such conditions the movements could only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
be guided by general instructions, and even the leaders
of lower grades had to be left free to act at their own
individual discretion. Specific orders for each day,
though they would of course be issued, could not in
many cases be possibly carried out. In the Army
Headquarter it could not be foreseen in what situation
each individual corps might find itself after a day's
fighting. Reports could only come in very late at
night, and the orders drawn up however early would
often arrive only after the troops, because of the shortness
of the day, had already set out on the march.</p>

<p><i>January 7th.</i>&mdash;In obedience to orders from the Army
Headquarter, General Voigts-Rhetz on the 7th sent
the part of the 19th Division which had already
reached Vendôme, back to St. Amand in reinforcement.
The 38th Brigade had again entered that
place early in the day, and General von Hartmann,
taking over its command, advanced along the Château
Renault high road, the cavalry moving on both flanks.</p>

<p>The column first struck the enemy near Villechauve
at mid-day. A thick fog prevented the employment of
the artillery, and it was at the cost of heavy loss that
Villechauve, Pias, and various other farmsteads were
captured. Villeporcher and the adjacent villages
remained in possession of the French, who at about
two o'clock advanced by the high road to the attack
with several battalions. The weather had cleared, and
it was soon evident that this offensive was only intended
to mask the beginning of the enemy's retreat to the
westward. The troops took quarters where they stood,
and the reinforcements forwarded to them remained at
St. Amand.</p>

<p>The Xth Corps, awaiting the return of the latter,
remained in its quarters about La Chartre; only the
14th Cavalry Brigade went on up to La Richardière to
establish connection with the IIIrd Corps. But it did
not succeed in taking the village with dismounted
troopers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>General von Alvensleben<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> hoped to overtake the
French on the hither side of the glen of Braye, and
by turning their left wing to drive them on to the Xth
Corps, whose co-operation had been promised. The
IIIrd Corps advanced in the direction of Epuisay,
leaving one brigade to garrison Mazange, and when
tidings reached it on the march that the French had
evacuated Lunay and Fortan, that brigade also
followed by way of the latter village.</p>

<p>Epuisay was found to be strongly held, and in the
meantime the advanced guard of the IXth Corps,
advancing from Busloup, also arrived there. But it was
not till half-past one that the French were expelled from
the little town, which they had strongly barricaded; and
on the hither side of the Braye they renewed their resistance
in the numerous hamlets and farmsteads. A
long fire fight was kept up in the thick fog; but at
length, at about four o'clock, the 12th Brigade pushed
forward to the edge of the valley. The 9th Brigade
took possession of Savigny without meeting any serious
opposition, and Sargé was stormed in the dusk.</p>

<p>The IIIrd Corps had lost forty-five men and had
taken 200 prisoners. It found quarters behind the
Braye, but threw forward outposts on its western bank.
The IXth Corps found shelter in and about Epuisay,
and thus, as a matter of fact, two corps were now
crowded on one of the few available roads. The 2nd
Cavalry Division went to the right, towards Mondoubleau,
to make connection with the XIIIth Corps.
The French retreated to St. Calais.</p>

<p>The order from the Army Head-quarter that the
XIIIth Corps was to march to Montmirail, had been
issued on the presumption that it would have reached
Nogent le Rotrou on the 6th, whereas in fact, as has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
been shown, it had remained at La Fourche, Beaumont,
and Unverre. The Grand Duke, who expected
to experience a stout resistance, did not pass to the
attack of Nogent till the 7th. When the 22nd Division
arrived there, it found all the villages deserted in the
Upper Huisne valley and was able to enter Nogent without
any fighting at two o'clock. It took up quarters
there, the 4th Cavalry Division at Thirion Gardais;
and only an advanced guard followed the enemy. It
found the wood near Le Gibet strongly occupied, and
did not succeed in forcing it till after nightfall.</p>

<p>The French had retired to La Ferté Bernard.</p>

<p>The 17th Division had at first followed in reserve.
But at one o'clock, in consequence of the reports
brought in, the Grand Duke detached it southward to
Authon; and in order to follow the Head-quarter instructions
as closely as possible he did at least push a
detachment of two battalions, two cavalry regiments,
and one battery towards Montmirail, under the command
of General von Rauch.</p>

<p><i>January 8th.</i>&mdash;Finding on the morning of the 8th
that the enemy was not advancing to the attack of St.
Amand, General von Hartmann at nine o'clock sent
back the troops which had crossed the river to his
support. At ten o'clock also he received instructions
to join the Xth Corps; but the French still continued
to hold Villeporcher and the forest lying behind it, and
were also drawn up across the Château Renault high
road in a very advantageous position behind the
Brenne. The General recognized the necessity of
making a decisive stand here, and took the best means
to that end by acting himself on the offensive. Supported
by the fire of his battery, and accompanied by the
cavalry on either flank, six companies of the 60th
Regiment marched on Villeporcher, drove back its
defenders in flight into the forest of Château Renault,
and took 100 prisoners. On the left the 9th Uhlans drove
the Chasseurs d'Afrique before them. Not till darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
had set in did General von Hartmann proceed in the
direction of Montoire.</p>

<p>General von Voigts-Rhetz had already set out from
thence very early in the day. The night's frost had
covered the roads with ice, which cruelly impeded all
movements of troops. The road on the right bank of
the Loir was in many places broken up. It passed
through a succession of narrow defiles, and on emerging
from these the advanced guard found itself face to face
with a force of about 1000 Gardes-Mobiles, who had
taken up a position in front of La Chartre. Their
mitrailleuses were soon forced to a hasty retreat by the
fire of two field-guns, but it was only after a prolonged
struggle that the infantry, moving with difficulty,
succeeded at 4 o'clock in entering the town, where it
took up quarters. Two battalions which were sent
further on the road, had to fight for their night's
shelter, and all through the night were exchanging shots
with the enemy at close quarters, of whom 230 were
taken prisoners.</p>

<p>The 39th Brigade, which left Ambloy in the
morning, could follow the corps only as far as
Sougé.</p>

<p>General von Schmidt with the 14th Cavalry Brigade
was sent to the right, to try to make connection with
the IIIrd Corps. He was received at Vancé with a
sharp fire. The leading squadron made way for the
horse battery, and a volley of grape-shot from the
foremost gun drove the dismounted hostile Cuirassiers
behind the hedges. When two more guns were brought
up into position, their shell fire dispersed in every
direction a long column of cavalry.</p>

<p>Colonel von Alvensleben pursued the French cavalry
with the 15th Uhlan Regiment till he came upon a
body of infantry guarding the Etang-fort brook. The
brigade halted at Vancé, after putting about 100
French <i>hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>Of the IIIrd Corps the 6th Division had moved forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
through St. Calais. The French tried to hold the
cuttings on the greatly broken up roads; but they
nowhere awaited a serious attack, and made off, for
the most part in carts which were in waiting. The
5th Division, proceeding on a parallel front on the left,
met with no opposition; but the state of the roads
made the march extremely difficult. The corps halted
on the hither side of Bouloire. The IXth Corps came
up behind it into St. Calais.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke had moved both Divisions of the
XIIIth Corps on La Ferté Bernard. On their way
they came across none but stragglers, but they found
the roads so utterly cut up that not till four in the
afternoon did they reach the place, where they took up
quarters. The French had retired to Connerré. The
4th Cavalry Division was to secure the right flank on
the further advance, but could not get as far forward
as Bellême; on the other hand, General von Rauch's
(commanding 15th Cavalry Division) detachment
despatched leftward towards Montmirail, surprised the
French in Vibraye, and took possession of the bridge
over the Braye.</p>

<p>By the evening of this day the two flank Corps of
the German Army were at an equal distance from
Le Mans, both on the same high road which crosses
the district of the Quere from La Ferté Bernard in
a southerly direction through St. Calais and La
Chartre; the IIIrd Corps was further in advance,
separated from each of them by the interval of a long
march. A closer concentration of the forces could be
attained only by a further advance along the converging
highways. Prince Frederick Charles therefore
issued an order at ten o'clock that evening, for the
Xth Corps to march next day to Parigné l'Evêque, the
IIIrd to Ardenay, and the XIIIth on to the heights of
Montfort, the advanced guard of each to be pushed
forward beyond these respective points. The IXth,
in the centre, was to follow, while General von Hartmann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
was to protect Vendôme with the 38th Brigade
and the 1st Division of Cavalry.</p>

<p>But the distances prevented the flanking corps
advancing from La Chartre and La Ferté from reaching
their respective destinations, and, on the 9th of January,
snow-storms, ice-bound roads, and thick fog further
combined to make their progress arduous beyond
conception.</p>

<p><i>January 9th.</i>&mdash;General von Hartmann marched the
38th Infantry Brigade on Château Renault, and entered
the town at one o'clock, to find that Curten's French
Division had started early in the morning for St.
Laurent.</p>

<p>The incomplete Xth Corps moved this day in two
columns; the detachment of General von Woyna (commanding
39th Infantry Brigade) was to march from
Pont de Braye by Vancé, the remainder of the corps
from La Chartre by way of Brives to Grand Lucé.</p>

<p>The 20th Division had scarcely set out by this route
from L'Homme, when it encountered shell and mitrailleuse-fire.
Here there happened for once to be room
for three batteries to advance, but in the heavy snow-fall
aim was out of the question. The infantry, however,
by degrees drove the enemy out of sundry hamlets
and farmsteads, and back across the Brives. To pursue
him beyond that stream a makeshift bridge needed first
to be thrown across with some loss of time, and then
Chahaignes was to be seized. But in the narrow valley
which had to be now traversed a vigorous resistance
was to be counted on. The state of the road was such
that the artillerymen and cavalry had to dismount and
lead their horses. The General in command rode on
a gun-carriage; his staff went on foot. Some horses
which had fallen in front presently stopped the way
for the whole column; and it therefore became necessary
to send back all the Corps-artillery, which was to
try next day to come on by way of Vancé.</p>

<p>To facilitate the march of the 20th Division, General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
von Woyna had been instructed to deviate from his
direct road and attack the enemy's left. When he approached
the valley the fighting had fallen silent, and
the detachment turned back to Vancé; but at Brives
at about half-past three the main column met with
fresh resistance, being received with a brisk fire from
the heights north-east of the village. Not even the infantry
could move outside of the high road, so there
was no alternative to a frontal advance along it. A
closed attack by the 39th Brigade broke up and routed
the enemy. At half-past six in the evening, when quite
dark, Colonel von Valentini set out for St. Pierre with
four battalions, and took there 100 French prisoners
and a loaded train of 100 waggons. The Xth Corps
spent the night with only its advance in Brives and
Vancé, but its quarters reached back nearly to the valley
of the Loir. Nor had the 14th Brigade of Cavalry
been able to make any further headway.</p>

<p>Of the IIIrd Corps the 6th Division had marched
by the high road through Bouloire, with the artillery
corps; the 5th on the left along the by-roads. The
advanced guard of the 6th Division, after a lively
fire-fight, expelled the enemy from his positions
in front of Ardenay, but there at two o'clock had to
encounter a determined resistance. After General de
Jouffroy had withdrawn from St. Calais to the southward,
General Chanzy pushed forward Paris' Division to
secure the high road leading from thence to Le Mans.
It had taken up a position near Ardenay, occupying the
château on the right, and on the left posting four guns
and two mitrailleuses near La Butte. To oppose
these there was only room on the road for two German
guns, which, however, in the course of half an hour
silenced the mitrailleuses, and carried on the unequal
contest with the greatest obstinacy. At about four
o'clock five companies of the 12th Brigade stormed the
château of Ardenay, while others, crossing the meadowland
to the right, forced their way through a patch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
wood towards La Butte. As night came on the French
tried to effect a general attack along the chaussée; but
this was repulsed, and the Brandenburgers<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> plunged
through the heavy fire of the defenders, and without
firing a shot took La Butte and Ardenay with a rush
and a cheer. The French were thrown back into the
valley of the Narais, losing many prisoners.</p>

<p>On the right a detachment of one battalion, two
squadrons, and two guns, accompanied the 6th Division.
It drove before it franctireur bodies, but at La Belle
Inutile met with more serious resistance. The post
was, however, carried by the 24th Regiment, which
made prize of a large ammunition and provision train,
and took above 100 unwounded prisoners. Count zu
Lynar moved into the village for its defence.</p>

<p>The 5th Division met with no opposition, but the
state of the roads caused extreme delay to its progress.
It was not till the afternoon that its head reached the
Narais at Gué de l'Aune and took up quarters there
and rearward to St. Mars de Locquenay. Its advanced
guard went on, however, to La Buzardière, thus forming
the absolute head of the whole army. Parigné
l'Evêque, on its left flank, was found to be held by the
enemy.</p>

<p>The IXth Corps followed the IIIrd to Bouloire.</p>

<p>Orders from head-quarters had not yet reached La
Ferté when, at nine in the morning, the Grand Duke
set the XIIIth Corps in motion on Connerré. Soon
after midday the 17th Division came upon the French
near Sceaux, and in a struggle wherein it slowly
gained ground, drove them first out of the village
precincts and then off the road. The French, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
had retreated to Connerré by a forced night march,
lost above 500 prisoners in this small affair. But the
short day was closing in, and the advanced guard
halted at dusk at Duneau. A detachment going
further forward found Connerré occupied by the
French, and many watch-fires blazing in the valley
of the Due. The main body of the infantry found
quarters in and about Sceaux.</p>

<p>Rauch's detachment, ordered to rejoin the Corps,
took possession of Le Croset and of the bridge over the
Due in front of that village, and also expelled the
French from Thorigné.</p>

<p>The French stayed in Connerré only till the evening;
then, leaving a company in occupation, they continued
their retreat. This necessarily led from the left bank
of the Huisne through the quarters taken up by the
IIIrd German Corps, which was disturbed all night by
wandering detachments of the enemy, even at Nuillé,
where the Divisional headquarters lay.</p>

<p>On the extreme right the 4th Cavalry Division occupied
Bellême, after driving out the French battalion
which had been in occupation there.</p>

<p>Thus on this day the centre of the IInd Army had
fought its way to within about nine miles of Le Mans;
while the two wings were still some distance behind.
As it was probable that the French would accept battle
in a prepared position behind the Huisne, it seemed
advisable to await the arrival of the Xth and XIIIth
Corps; but on the other hand, this would also give the
enemy time to strengthen himself. Were an immediate
attack determined on, the two Divisions which had
been delayed respectively at Château Renault and Le
Chartre, could scarcely reach Le Mans in time, and
the rest of the army would be involved everywhere in
a disadvantageous contest with the hostile bodies which
were being driven back concentrically on that place.
Prince Frederick Charles therefore ordered the IIIrd
Corps to push on through Ardenay; the Xth was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
advance to Parigné, and the XIIIth on St. Mars la
Bruyère, though these points could scarcely be reached
from the positions actually occupied by the respective
Corps this same evening (9th).</p>

<p>As we have seen, the French army now assembled
about Le Mans had been acting on the offensive on
January 6th, when General Jouffroy had advanced on
Vendôme, and de Curten on St. Amand. But so early
as the 7th the French found themselves reduced to the
defensive along their whole front, some 50 miles in length.
General Rousseau, on the left wing, had evacuated Nogent
le Rotrou, and, without being pressed, began his retreat
by a night march to Connerré. In the centre, the
trough of the Braye was wrested from General Jouffroy;
he quitted St. Calais, not rearward on Le Mans, but
southward to join General Barry. On the right, General
Curten had abandoned Château Renault, and set out, unpursued,
on the line through Château du Loir. To effect
some concert in the operations of the three Divisions
of his right wing, General Chanzy placed them under
the superior orders of Admiral Jauréguiberry. He
pushed forward the Division Paris on Ardenay by the
high road General Jouffroy had uncovered, and on the
left wing he reinforced General Rousseau by stationing
three Divisions more on either side of his line of
retreat. General Jouffroy was to retire to Parigné
l'Evêque, and a Division was sent to meet him there
and at Changé.</p>

<p>General de Curten succeeded on the 9th in checking
the progress of the German left wing for some time
about Chahaignes; but the Division Paris was driven
back through Ardenay, and General Rousseau, thus
beset in Connerré, evacuated that village the same
evening. The two Divisions of the right wing were
behind as far as Jupilles and Neuillé Pont Pierre.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances General Chanzy ordered
that on the 10th the Division Jouffroy should fall back
on Parigné l'Evêque, but that the Division Paris should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
once more move forward on Ardenay. He sent the
remaining three Divisions of the XXIst Corps to meet
General Rousseau, with instructions that he was to
retake Connerré and Thorigné.</p>

<p>The offensive movements thus planned by both sides
developed into the fierce battle which, on the German
side, was fought out single-handed by the IIIrd
Corps.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Battle in Front of le Mans.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(10th, 11th, and 12th of January.)</div>


<p><i>January 10th.</i>&mdash;<i>The Fighting about Parigné and
Changé.</i>&mdash;Owing to the peculiar nature of the country,
deep columns could not deploy without great loss of
time. General von Alvensleben therefore advanced in
the centre with the 9th and 11th Infantry Brigades on
Changé from Gué de l'Aune and Ardenay, moving
on a broad front in comparatively small separate
bodies. On the right the 12th marched by the high
road to Le Mans; on the left the 10th was to start from
Volnay when Parigné should be found abandoned by
the French, and leaving that place on its left, was also
to converge on Changé.</p>

<p>Parigné had, in fact, been deserted by the French,
but had been reoccupied before daybreak by a brigade
of the Division Deplanque; and even before the German
troops had started, the far-advanced outposts towards
the forest of Loudon were smartly attacked. The
greater part of the 9th Brigade had to be deployed by
degrees between Blinières and the point of the forest, but
only seven guns could be brought into action against the
numerous French artillery. General von Stülpnagel
decided to reserve his strength for the struggle at
Changé, and to carry on merely a stationary fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
here, which must be inevitably decided as soon as the
10th Brigade should make its appearance on the left.</p>

<p>That brigade, delayed by the badness of the roads,
did not arrive by way of Challes till noon; but it
brought two batteries to reinforce the German artillery
strength, which now vigorously prepared the infantry
attack on the high-lying Parigné. Half an hour
later the battalions rushed on the place with shouts
of "Hurrah Brandenburg!" taking a gun which the
enemy had abandoned, and two mitrailleuses still in
action. When the French returned to try to recover
them they were again repulsed, and sacrificed another
gun, two colours, and several waggons. After losing
2150 prisoners they fled to the shelter of the forest of
Ruaudin. General von Stülpnagel left two battalions
at Parigné to maintain observation in that quarter, and
hurried on to Changé in two columns. In front of this
village, at about three o'clock, the 11th Brigade met
with a violent resistance at the Gué Perray brook from
the other brigade of Deplanque's Division. The 2nd
Battalion of the 35th Regiment lost nine officers and
above 100 men in a severe struggle at Les Gars. The
General in command, who was on the spot, dislodged
both flanks of the enemy from his strong position, and
on the left two companies succeeded in crossing the
stream at La Goudrière.</p>

<p>These at four o'clock now fell in with the advanced
guard of the 9th Brigade, which Colonel Count von der
Groeben was bringing up from Parigné, having taken
possession of the Château of Girardrie on the way.
When the companies of the 11th Brigade sent to the
right reached Auvigné simultaneously, the "General
Advance" was sounded. Auvigné was stormed, the
bridge north of Gué la Hart was crossed, and that
village carried after a hard fight. Over 1000 prisoners
more were taken from the flying French.</p>

<p>It was already dark, but Changé, the goal of the
struggle, was not yet reached. But when a barricade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
outside the village had been won it was found that the
10th Brigade was already in possession. This brigade,
on its way along the high road from Parigné, had met
with resistance at the Châteaux Chef Raison and Paillerie.
Having only two guns, it failed to silence the French
artillery, but General von Stülpnagel left there only
a battalion in observation, and hurried forward with
part of the brigade to reinforce the fight at Gué la
Hart; the other portion was directed against Changé.
Here the French had already been for the most part
dismissed to quarters, but they soon assembled and made
a prompt and determined resistance. There ensued an
embittered street-fight, which ended in about an hour's
time in the surrender of the whole garrison of 800 men,
who had been crowded together into the market-place.</p>

<p>The 12th Brigade had at last left Ardenay at eleven
o'clock; it advanced along the high road without opposition
as far as St. Hubert, where an abandoned
commissariat train was seized. Having there aligned
itself with the rest of the Corps it halted for a while,
but after one o'clock was fired upon by French artillery;
and the enemy again advancing along the highway,
General von Buddenbrock<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> on his part passed to the
attack, and drove back the enemy out of Champagné,
in part across the Huisne, and in part to the heights
behind the village. Two guns successfully dealt with
the fire of the French artillery near Lune d'Auvours,
and then the infantry expelled the French from that
shelter also.</p>

<p>Further to the right a German battalion had taken
St. Mars la Bruyère after a slight skirmish, and was
subsequently joined there by General Count zu Lynar's
detachment.</p>

<p>Fighting thus with equal skill and success the IIIrd
Corps had indeed already lost 450 men; but it had
brought in more than 5000 prisoners, and had won
many trophies of which it had a right to be proud.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>
<p>The Xth Corps had started this day from Vancé and
Brives, and unobstructed indeed by the enemy, but
along very heavy roads, reached Grand Lucé at two
o'clock. Here it took up quarters.</p>

<p>The IXth Corps remained at Nuillé.</p>

<p>Of the XIIIth Corps the 17th Division had continued
its advance along the left bank of the Huisne, and found
Connerré already deserted by the French. But on the
further side of the river the heights of Cohernières, the
railway station, and the wood to the north, were occupied
by the 2nd Division of the French XXIst Corps.
General von Rauch led two battalions to the attack
from the south, in which shared the 22nd Division from
the east, having crossed the Huisne at Sceaux and taken
the direction of Beillé by the right bank. A stubborn
resistance was encountered, and the fight swayed to and
fro till darkness fell. The Château of Couléon, indeed,
and several villages at the foot of the wooded heights
were taken, but the French maintained their hold on
the heights and their position at Cohernières.</p>

<p>The 17th Division had meanwhile continued its advance
along roads frozen as smooth as glass, and reached
La Belle Inutile; the 22nd passed the night at Beillé.</p>

<p>This division had in the morning sent a detachment
sideward to Bonnétable, whither the 4th Cavalry
Division now proceeded. The 12th Cavalry Brigade
followed to Bellême. Colonel von Beckedorff then
continued his advance to Chanteloup, whence he drove
out the French in spite of an obstinate defence.</p>

<p>General Chanzy had determined to risk a decisive
battle in front of Le Mans. Curten's Division had not
yet reached him, and only a part of Barry's had come up,
but on the other hand the army from the camp of
Conlie, in strength some 10,000 men, had arrived. The
right wing of the French position rested its flank on the
Sarthe near Arnaye<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; it extended for more than four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
miles along the Chemin aux B&oelig;ufs, and continued in a
slight curve leftward to the Huisne. Barry's Division,
already weakened by previous reverses, and General
Lalande's National Guards&mdash;undisciplined and badly
armed troops&mdash;were posted on the extreme right which
was the least threatened. Deplanque's and Roquebrune's
Divisions, Desmaison's Brigade and Jouffroy's
Division, held the centre and left, the last body in the first
instance opposite to General von Alvensleben. Behind
this line Bouëdec's Division and Colonel Marty's detachment
constituted a reserve. In all from 50,000 to 60,000
men under the command of Admiral Jauréguiberry,
with full ranks and well commanded, crowded the
entrenched front of the most important section of the
line&mdash;that between the two rivers (Sarthe and Huisne).
Five Divisions more, under the command of General
de Colomb, lined the right bank of the Huisne for a
distance of about eight and a half miles, the Division
Paris was at Yvré; Gougeard's Division, also
holding the heights of Auvours on the hither side, was
northward of Champagné; then came Rousseau's Division
at Montfort and Pont de Gesnes, and finally, Collin's
Division in hook-formation about Lombron. Besides
these Villeneuve's Division, quite on the flank, fronted
toward Chanteloup.</p>

<p><i>January 11th.</i>&mdash;On this day the IIIrd German
Army Corps was directly opposed to the main body
of the French forces. It could not for the present
hope for any assistance from the corps of the
flanks, and had before it the certainty of an arduous
struggle.</p>

<p>On the left, the Xth Corps was still this morning at
Grand Lucé, and on the right the XIIIth Corps had
been detained on the previous day by the obstinate
resistance of the French, who had held their own
between Les Cohernières and La Chapelle, and occupied
Le Chêne in their front.</p>

<p>The troops of the 22nd Division had necessarily lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
their formations and become mixed up in the course of
the struggle in the wood, and it was not till they
had been re-formed and the enemy's position had been
reconnoitred by both the Divisional Commanders that
the attack was renewed at about eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>Two battalions of the 17th Division and one battery
were left in observation in front of Pont de Gesnes,
on the southern bank of the Huisne; on the northern
side, the Mecklenburg battalions stormed Cohernières
in the afternoon after a sharp contest, and in conjunction
with the Hessians forced their way westward
up to the Gué and on towards Lombron about four
o'clock.</p>

<p>Further to the right two companies of the 90th
Regiment (22nd Division) meanwhile took Le Chêne
by a closed attack on the obstinate defenders; the
83rd Regiment, after a sharp fire fight, stormed the
farmsteads of Flouret and La Grande Métairie. Colonel
von Beckedorff, on being relieved at Chanteloup by the
4th Cavalry Division, had driven the French out of St.
Célerin, and he then advanced to La Chapelle-St. Rémy
on the right of the Division, which occupied wide
quarters behind the points it had seized.</p>

<p>The Mecklenburg Grenadiers had held their own for
a long time at Le Gué and La Brosse against superior
numbers attacking from Pont de Gesnes; but the
main body of the 17th Division was retired in the
evening further back to Connerré.</p>

<p>The more completely that General von Alvensleben
had to rely solely on his own command, the more essential
it was to keep the troops composing it closely concentrated.
But a strong force of the enemy was now
on his flank, almost indeed in his rear, on the heights of
Auvours, where it was only kept at bay by his 12th
Brigade, which therefore for the present was not free
to advance.</p>

<p>And here it was that the battle first really began.
The French had repossessed themselves of Champagné,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and had deployed artillery on the heights behind
it. When their fire had been subdued by four guns
of the brigade, two battalions advanced to an attack
on the village. It was not till after an obstinate
street-fight, that the enemy at eleven o'clock was
driven back to the heights, and the bridge over the
Huisne carried. General von Buddenbrock now let
the two battalions remain in observation, sent a third
to Lune d'Auvours, and at noon started with the rest
of the brigade to rejoin the Corps.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the conflict had been raging with such fury
all along the front of the latter that at twelve o'clock
Prince Frederick Charles sent orders from St. Hubert to
General Voigts-Rhetz, to hurry forward by the shortest
roads to the battle-field with the Xth Corps; and at
the same time General von Manstein was instructed
to seize the heights of Auvours with the IXth.</p>

<p>It was already one o'clock when the advanced guard
of the IXth climbed up the hollow way, deep in snow,
followed by two battalions of the 12th Brigade, and
by two batteries straining every nerve. The infantry
plunged forward through the wood, strongly held as it
was by the enemy, straight on Villiers; the skirmishers
of the Fusilier battalion of the 11th Regiment seized
three mitrailleuses in action, and when the French had
abandoned the village, turned them against the wood.</p>

<p>Further to the left, at about three o'clock, two
battalions of the 85th Regiment from the main body
of the 18th Division, were directed on the western
end of the ridge, supported by the Jägers and two
batteries which were brought up near Les Hêtres. To
cover them two companies moved on La Lune, and
baulked for the moment the hostile rush along the high
road. But against these movements the French opened
a heavy fire from their commanding batteries behind
Yvré. Regardless thereof the Holsteiners<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
left charged on a hostile battery and seized three of its
guns. On the right they took possession of the neighbouring
farmsteads; and soon after five the French
abandoned the whole plateau as far as its western
edge.</p>

<p>Over it, however, a strong counter-attack was
delivered in the evening, when part of Gougeard's
Division charged up the slope from Yvré. Its further
advance was arrested; but the French could not be
prevented from remaining there during the evening
and night. Nevertheless, this offensive struggle on the
part of the 18th Division had relieved the pressure on
the rear and flank of the IIIrd Corps. It received
the further order in the evening to secure the
passage over the Huisne for use next day. Three
battalions and one battery immediately crossed over to
the northern bank and drove from the bridge the hostile
detachments in its vicinity. The Division lost 275
men.</p>

<p>General von Alvensleben had delayed the advance
of the IIIrd Corps till eleven o'clock, in anticipation of
the arrival of the 12th Brigade.</p>

<p>During the night (10&mdash;11th) the French had completed
their entrenchments on the skirts of the wood and
had taken up their position there; they also lined the
heights on the further side of the river with numerous
batteries. Thus a frontal attack must involve heavy
loss, and it was impossible to out-flank lines so extensive.
General von Alvensleben therefore decided
on advancing at first only against the enemy's left
wing, and assigned to that task the 11th Brigade.
The 10th and 9th remained in reserve for the present
about Changé and Gué la Hart. The 12th, released at
Mont-Auvours, was indeed marching up, but on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
circuitous ways, because the high road was everywhere
entirely commanded by the batteries on the
heights.</p>

<p>The 11th Brigade, scarcely 3000 strong, followed
the course of the Gué Perray streamlet up to the
northern end of the wood. To protect it against
the French columns threatening it from the heights,
the 35th Regiment had to form front towards the brook
and also occupied the Château of Les Arches. The
20th Regiment tried to get forward by the cattle-path,
and while holding firmly the Château of Les Noyers
and the bridge there over the Huisnes, drove back
the enemy by sheer hard fighting to Les Granges.
But he presently returned so considerably reinforced
that the whole brigade had to be gradually
brought up into the fighting line. Les Granges
was lost and retaken several times with heavy loss,
particularly of officers; but the Brandenburgers
fought on staunchly.</p>

<p>On the left of the 11th the 10th Brigade now made
its appearance, coming up from Changé at one o'clock.
After an hour-long bloody struggle the 52nd Regiment
made itself master of the farm of Le Pavillon, of the
wooded slope in front, and the farm of Grand Anneau.
Strong columns advancing from Pontlieue were driven
back, two batteries dashed up into the Chassepôt fire
to within 800 paces of Le Tertre; yet the 12th Regiment
did not succeed in getting into the farmstead till
two battalions of the 9th Brigade from Changé had
come up to its assistance. The farmstead whose possession
was so obstinately disputed was taken by storm at
about five o'clock, with the co-operation of the Grenadiers
of the 8th Life-Regiment.</p>

<p>The 52nd Regiment, having expended all its ammunition,
had to retire, but the Grenadier battalions pushed
further forward on the cattle-path, where two French
guns in action were captured after a bloody mêlée;
and the enemy's repeated attempts to recover them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
were steadily frustrated. A hostile battery which had
been brought up westward of the wood was driven
back by quick fire.</p>

<p>As the 35th Regiment had to be brought forward
from the Gué Perray brook to support the 20th, the
French had recovered possession of Les Arches. The
12th Brigade, only three battalions strong, arrived there
from Auvours at two o'clock. The 64th Regiment
recaptured the château after a short fight. The overwhelming
artillery and musketry fire from the heights
on the further side of the river prevented the German
artillery from coming into action, and it was only with
great difficulty and a heavy sacrifice of gunners that
the pieces were brought away again; but every attack
on the château by the French from Yvré was steadily
repulsed.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, and only the fire of the
cannon still lasted. The IIIrd Corps had taken 600
prisoners, but had also lost 500 men. It had fought its
way into the heart of the French position, and its outposts
were in the closest proximity to the enemy's
front. And now strong, though late, reinforcements
arrived.</p>

<p>The Xth Corps had marched from Grand Lucé to
the westward in the morning, to gain the high road
from Tours to Le Mans, but slippery roads again
delayed its march, so that it only reached Teloche in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>The cannon thunder heard to the northward left no
doubt that General von Alvensleben was engaged in
arduous fighting. The orders sent at noon from the
Army Headquarter in St. Hubert sped to General
Voigts-Rhetz; but that officer rightly judged that his
appearance would now have a more telling effect on the
enemy's flank than on the field where the IIIrd Corps
was engaged. So in spite of the exhausted state of his
men, who had had no opportunity to cook on the
way, he at once pushed forward without halting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>To protect himself against Curten's Division on
the watch for him from Château du Loir, he despatched
a battalion to Ecommoy. It was received
with firing from the houses, surrounded on all sides in
the darkness, and compelled to withdraw from the
place; but it then kept the road clear in the rear of
the corps.</p>

<p>The head of the 20th Division found Mulsanne but
feebly defended, and drove the detachment back beyond
the cutting of La Monnerie.</p>

<p>The nature of the country which here had to be
traversed greatly favoured the enemy. Ditches and
fences afforded his marksmen complete cover, farmsteads
and copses furnished excellent defensive positions.
Only eight guns could at first be brought to bear against
the enemy's artillery; but nevertheless four Westphalian
and Brunswick<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> battalions steadily repelled the French,
and by nightfall reached Point du Jour. The fight
first became stationary on the cattle-path in front of
Les Mortes Aures. Here the French swept the whole
foreground with a continuous rolling fire from tiers of
shelter-trenches rising one above the other.</p>

<p>The fight swayed to and fro for a long time, but
finally the German left gained ground. The 1st
Battalion of the 17th Regiment rushed on the enemy,
who delivered his fire at point blank range and then
made for the wood. And when now the 1st Battalion of
the 56th Regiment advanced from Point du Jour, its
drums beating the charge, the French carried away
their mitrailleuses and evacuated Les Mortes Aures.</p>

<p>This battalion had received orders from the Commanding
General to settle the business with the
bayonet. Captain von Monbart led it on locked up close
at the charging pace; all the detachments at hand
joined it, and in spite of a heavy fire from the wood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>La Tuilerie was reached by half-past eight; and here
the 40th Brigade deployed, while the 37th stood ready
to support it in front of Mulsanne. The enemy drifted
away in the darkness. The constant roll of wheels, the
noise of departing railway trains and the confusion of
cries indicated a retreat. Yet the prisoners who were
constantly being brought in, with one accord reported
that a strong force was still encamped in the forest.
Numerous watch-fires blazed there through the night,
and instead of resting, it seemed evident that the
hostile troops were preparing to engage in fresh
attempts. At half-past ten the outposts reported the
approach of a strong force from Pontlieue.</p>

<p>Hitherto it had been only the little-to-be-relied-on
National Guards under General Lalande at this point
with whom the German troops in this quarter of the
field had had to deal; but the Admiral now sent
Bouëdec's Division against La Tuilerie, and ordered
General Roquebrune to support his advance.</p>

<p>For a full hour the Prussian battalions in first line
were scourged with rifle fire in front and flank, and
pelted by a hail-storm of projectiles, but no serious
attack occurred.</p>

<p>According to French reports, the officers strove in
vain to bring forward their troops; but the latter constantly
hung back. A later assault made by Gardes-Mobiles
was equally fruitless.</p>

<p>But still there was to be no rest. At two in the
morning the din of fighting again made itself heard on
the right. Deplanque's Division had been disturbed by
a flank detachment of the 40th Brigade. This body was
advancing by the road from Ruaudin to Pontlieue, to be
at hand in case of need; without returning the enemy's
fire, it had driven out the holders of Epinettes, and had
established itself there close to the cattle-path.</p>

<p><i>January 12th.</i>&mdash;For the impending struggle of the
following day only the IIIrd and Xth Corps could be
counted on. The other two Corps could only co-operate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
indirectly by holding engaged a part of the
hostile forces.</p>

<p>Of the XIIIth Corps the 17th Division was to advance
by Lombron to St. Corneille, without committing
itself to a contest with the enemy still holding
the bank of the Huisne; the 22nd was ordered from
La Chapelle to Savigné. The Gué brook was to be
lightly held, and part of the artillery was to remain at
Connerré with the 7th Brigade of Cavalry.</p>

<p>On advancing it was found that the enemy had
already abandoned Lombron, Pont de Gesnes, and
Montfort. Arms and equipments thrown away betrayed
how hurried had been the flight. Many stragglers
were brought in prisoners, and it was not till
reaching the Merdereau brook at noon, that the 17th
Division met with opposition. The Château of Hyre
and St. Corneille were won about four o'clock by
an enveloping attack, and 500 French were taken
prisoners. The enemy was then driven back behind
the Parance brook, where the advanced guard halted
at dusk.</p>

<p>Colonel von Beckedorff's detachment of the 22nd
Division marched through Chanteloup from Sillé,
throwing back the enemy on La Croix, where a large
body of hostile troops made a stand. But when, after
a long halt, the main body of the Division came up, it
at once passed to the attack. Entire formed bodies of
French here laid down their arms, and 3000 men
with many officers became prisoners.</p>

<p>An attempt of the cavalry to advance across the
Sarthe to break up the railway on the further side of
the river was, however, unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The whole force occupying the heights of Auvours
surrendered to the IXth Corps. The 35th Brigade
marched up to Villiers, but patrols sent ahead soon
reported that the French had retired across the Huisne.
When the noise of fighting was heard at mid-day
from St. Corneille, the brigade in question was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
ordered to proceed northward to support the 17th
Division engaged there. The 84th Regiment, passing
through La Commune, lent efficient assistance in
the attack on Château Hyre. Outposts were left on
the Parance for the night, but the main body of
the 35th Brigade returned to Fatines, and the 36th
took up quarters between Villiers and St. Mars la
Bruyère.</p>

<p>By the battle of the previous day the position of
the French before Le Mans had been forced; but they
still stood firm behind the Huisnes, and as their left
wing had been driven in on their centre, the latter section
had been considerably strengthened. There still
remained the stream to be crossed, and the steep slope
to be climbed, where every row of the vineyards in
terraced ascent was held by strong firing lines, and the
crest of which was crowned with batteries. The passage
of the Huisnes near Ivré, on the left, was covered by
entrenchments with special carefulness, and the ground
in front of the wood of Pontlieue had been made impassable
in many places by abatis. Against such a
position the artillery could be of little and the cavalry
of no service, while deep snow hampered every movement
of the infantry. General von Alvensleben therefore
decided on standing for the present on the defensive
with his right wing, while he prepared to support
the advance of General von Voigts-Rhetz with his left.</p>

<p>The troops were roused from their short rest at
six in the morning. Two French companies made
their way towards the bridge at Château Les Noyers
with powder-bags, but they were compelled to retreat,
leaving the explosives behind them. At eight
o'clock the French made a determined attack on the
outposts of the 12th Regiment in the wood, and drove
them in on Le Tertre. Again a combat raged furiously
about this farmstead, which was almost demolished by
shell fire. One by one the last battalions of the 10th
Brigade were drawn into the struggle, to replace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
bodies which, their ammunition exhausted, had to
retire. Only four guns could be used with effect, but
by eleven o'clock the enemy's fire gradually died away,
and he was seen to retire on Pontlieue. The battalions
of the left wing pursued, and came out on the Parigné
road in immediate touch with the Xth Corps.</p>

<p>General von Voigts-Rhetz had left two battalions at
Mulsanne, for his protection from the direction of Ecommoy;
the whole Corps, after many detachments had been
unavoidably detailed from it, was assembled by about
half-past seven for a further advance on Pontlieue.
The main body of the 20th Division closed up by the
Mulsanne road on La Tuilerie. Three battalions of
the 19th Division massed at Ruaudin to strengthen
the sideward detachments in Epinettes, while two
battalions with the 14th Cavalry Brigade and the
Corps' artillery, which could find no opening in the
region further to the left, moved up by the roads from
Parigné.</p>

<p>The reinforcement meanwhile arrived from Ruaudin,
and General von Woyna made his way without hindrance
through the forest to La Source, where he
halted at one o'clock, his front parallel with that of the
20th Division. A heavy battery of the latter had
already driven away the French mitrailleuses in front
of Pontlieue. On the right a light battery of the 19th
Division was brought up to La Source, and ten horse-artillery
guns on to the road from Parigné. The
atmosphere was, however, so thick that their fire
could only be directed by the map.</p>

<p>At two o'clock General von Kraatz advanced in close
column on Pontlieue, whither General von Woyna was
now also marching. The southern part of the village
was taken after a slight resistance; but on the further
side of the Huisne the French held the houses along
the river-bank, and just as the Germans approached
the bridge it was blown up. The demolition, however,
was not complete, and the foremost battalions got across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
over the débris to reach the enemy. Two made their
way into the high street of Pontlieue, one turned left to
the railway station, whence were heard signals for departing
trains. Nothing interposed to hinder the railway
bridge here from being blown up, and thus many
prisoners were taken, besides 150 provision waggons
and 1000 hundred-weight of flour.</p>

<p>The artillery fire was immediately directed on the
town of Le Mans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the detachments of the IIIrd Corps, which
had become mixed up in the forest fight, had re-formed.
After a ration of meat, the first for three days, had
been served out to the troops, the 10th Brigade resumed
its march. The Brandenburg Jäger Battalion
crossed the river by the paper-mill of L'Epau, and two
batteries strengthened from Château Funay the artillery
fire directed on Le Mans.</p>

<p>When presently the infantry entered the town, a
fierce struggle began in the streets, which were entirely
blocked by the French trains. Entrance into individual
houses had to be cleared by artillery fire; a large
number of French were taken prisoners, and a vast
quantity of waggons were seized. The fighting lasted
till nightfall, and then the Xth Corps and half of the
IIIrd took up alarm quarters in the town. The 6th
Division took possession of Yvré, which the enemy
had abandoned, and threw out foreposts to Les Noyers
and Les Arches on the further side of the Huisne.</p>

<p>The actions fought by the French on this day, had
been engaged in for the sole purpose of gaining time
for the extrication of the army.</p>

<p>On learning from Admiral Jauréguiberry that every
effort to get the troops to advance had failed, and that
the last reserves were shattered, General Chanzy had
at eight in the morning issued orders for a general
retreat on Alençon, where the Minister of War had
arranged for the arrival of two Divisions of the XIXth
Corps from Carentan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>The advance of the IInd Army to Le Mans had
been a series of seven days' incessant fighting. It was
made at a season when the winter was in extremest
severity. Ice and snow-drifts had rendered every
movement one long struggle. Bivouacking was out of
the question; and the troops had to seek their night
shelter often at a distance of some miles in rear; their
reassembling in the morning cost precious hours, and
the shortness of the day then prevented their taking
full advantage of their successes. Whole battalions were
employed in guarding the prisoners. The roads were
in such a state that the trains of the army could not
be brought up; officers and men alike marched insufficiently
clothed and on scanty rations. But zeal,
endurance, and discipline conquered every difficulty.</p>

<p>The army had sacrificed in this prolonged struggle
3200 men and 200 officers, the larger half belonging to
the IIIrd Corps alone. Many companies fought under
the command of non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>The French estimated their losses at 6200 men, and
20,000 taken prisoners; seventeen guns, two colours,
and an abundant supply of matériel remained as
trophies in the hands of the victors.</p>

<p>After exertions so severe the troops imperatively
needed some rest. The instructions from the supreme
Headquarter were that the operations were not to be
extended beyond a certain limit; and it was possible
that the services of the IInd Army might almost immediately
be required on the Seine and the Loire. Prince
Frederick Charles therefore determined to follow up
the retreating enemy with only a small force.</p>

<p>On the French side, that each Corps might have a
separate road for the retreat to Alençon, two Corps had
necessarily to draw out westward in the first instance.
On the evening of the last day's fight the XVIth Corps
reached Chauffour on the Laval road, and the XVIIth
Conlie on the road to Mayenne, each covered by
its rear-guard. The XXIst was assembled at Ballon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
on the left bank of the Sarthe. From these points all
were to march in a northerly direction. General
Chanzy still deluded himself with the hope of coming
up by Evreux to the assistance of the besieged capital.
He would have had thus to make a wide circuit&mdash;an
arc by moving on the chord of which the Germans could
easily have anticipated him; and in a country where all
arms were available, his army, in the condition to which
it was now reduced, must have inevitably been destroyed.
Ultimately the defeated French army retired
in the direction to the westward of the Sarthe.</p>

<p>After the distribution of rations and forage, General
von Schmidt set forth at mid-day on the 13th with four
battalions, eleven squadrons, and ten guns, and reached
Chauffour after some skirmishing. The XIIIth Corps
advanced to the Sarthe, the 17th Division sending its
outposts across the river at Neuville, and the 22nd
drove the French out of Ballon, whence they retired in
full flight to Beaumont. The XXIst French Corps had
taken up quarters this day at Sillé. The National
Guards of Brittany fled wildly to Coron, and thence
made homeward toward their own province. They
were joined by the troops left in camp at Conlie, after
the camp there had been plundered. The XVIIth
Corps also went off, without halting by the Vègre as
it had been ordered to do, but retreating direct on Ste.
Suzanne. The XVIth withdrew on Laval, leaving
Barry's Division at Chassillé as rear-guard. Numbers
of abandoned waggons and cast-away arms, everywhere
testified to the demoralization of the defeated forces.</p>

<p>On the 14th the French were driven out of Chassillé.
The XVIth Corps had by this time almost entirely lost
its organization; it retired during the night to St. Jean
sur Erve. In the camp at Conlie were found 8000
stands of arms and 5,000,000 cartridges, as well as
various other war matériel.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke had marched on Alençon along the
right bank of the Sarthe. The French in Beaumont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
made a feeble resistance to the advanced guard of the
22nd Division, and lost 1400 prisoners.</p>

<p>On the following day General von Schmidt advanced
further on the road to Laval, but found that the
French had concentrated at St. Jean and posted a
strong force of artillery on the heights behind the
Erve. The Oldenburg Regiment<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> forced its way as far
as the church of the little town, and the Brunswickers
drove the enemy back on Ste. Suzanne, higher up the
river, but there the pursuit ended.</p>

<p>Barry's and Deplanque's Divisions, according to the
French estimate, had now no more than 6000 fighting
men, and Curten's Division had still not yet come up,
but this strength was considerably superior to that of
the weak German detachment confronting it. The rest
of the Xth Corps was moving up in support, but had
as yet only reached Chasillé. A battalion advancing
from Conlie came into conflict at Sillé with the XXIst
French Corps assembled there, and sustained heavy loss.
The 22nd Division of the XIIIth Corps also met with
serious opposition before reaching Alençon, from the
National Guards and the volunteers under Lipowski;
and the attack on the town was postponed till next
day.</p>

<p>But on the following morning the French positions
in Alençon as well as in Sillé and St. Jean were abandoned.
Those places were at once occupied by the Germans,
and General von Schmidt marched forward,
close up to Laval. Numerous stragglers from the
retreating army were taken prisoners.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>
<p>Behind the Mayenne, whither now Curten's Division
had arrived, the remnants of the IInd Army of
the Loire re-assembled. Reduced to half its original
strength, and its morale gravely shaken, it could
but be unfit for service for a long time to come, and
the object of the German advance on Le Mans was
fully attained.</p>

<p>To the north of Paris, however, the French were
meanwhile threatening a renewed offensive. It was
necessary to draw in on the Somme the portions of the
Ist Army which were still on the Lower Seine; and
orders came from the supreme Head-quarter that
the XIIIth Corps of the IInd Army should march on
Rouen.</p>

<p>On the Upper Loire also French detachments had
advanced against the Hessian posts about Briare, and
had driven them back, on the 14th, to Ouzouer; while
from the Sologne came a report of the advance of a
newly-formed French Army Corps&mdash;the XXVth.</p>

<p>The German IXth Corps, after evacuating and
destroying the camp at Conlie, was therefore sent to
Orleans in support. The remainder of the IInd Army,
the IIIrd and Xth Corps with the three cavalry divisions&mdash;in
a strength of about 27,000 foot, 9000 horse, and
186 guns&mdash;was assembled by Prince Frederick Charles
round Le Mans. The cavalry in observation on the
front and flanks had several small skirmishes, but no
further serious hostilities were attempted.</p>

<p>The 4th Cavalry Division held Alençon on the right,
and on the left General von Hartmann entered Tours
without any opposition.</p>

<h2>OCCURRENCES NORTHWARD OF PARIS
DURING JANUARY.</h2>


<p>At the beginning of the New Year a considerable
part of the Ist German Army was engaged in besieging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Péronne, which had afforded a safe crossing-point for
the debouche of the French on the southern bank of
the Somme. General Barnekow held the little place
invested with the 3rd Reserve Division and the 31st
Infantry Brigade. Previously it had only been kept
under observation by cavalry, but circumstances had
temporarily given it importance. What of the VIIIth
Corps formerly on the Somme was available formed a
wide curve from Amiens northward as far as Bapaume,
to cover the siege.</p>

<p>The Ist Corps, posted at Rouen for the time, consisted
only of three brigades; but the 4th was on the
march thither from before Péronne, where it had been
relieved. No reinforcement of the Ist Army had been
effected. The 14th Division, after reducing Mézières
and, soon after, Rocroy, had received fresh orders from
Versailles which transferred it to another part of the
theatre of war.</p>

<p>General Faidherbe had concentrated his troops behind
the Scarpe, from their resting quarters south of Arras,
and had begun his forward march on January 2nd.
He advanced with the XXIInd Corps to the relief of
Péronne by way of Bucquoy. The XXIIIrd followed
by the high road to Bapaume. About half-past ten
Derroja's Division of the former Corps obliged the 3rd
Cavalry Division, as well as those battalions of the 32nd
Brigade which had been attached to it, to fall back on
Miraumont, followed, however, only as far as Achiet
le Petit.</p>

<p>The other Division, under General Bessol, did not
advance towards Achiet le Grand till the afternoon.
There it was opposed for several hours by two companies
of the 68th, a sub-division of Hussars, and two
guns, which only retired in the evening on Avesnes.
The French did not follow up the detachment, but
threw out outposts about Bihucourt.</p>

<p>Payen's Division deployed on the high road at Béhagnies,
and its batteries opened fire on Sapignies, where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
however, General von Strubberg had posted five battalions.
These repulsed the attack, and at two o'clock
entered Béhagnies with a rush, took 240 prisoners,
and prepared the village for defence. The enemy withdrew
to Ervillers, and there once again drew out, but
attempted no further attack.</p>

<p>The other Division of the French XXIIIrd Corps,
consisting of mobilized National Guards under General
Robin, moved forward on the left on Mory. There were
only one battalion and a squadron of Hussars to oppose
it. By extending their line on the heights of Beugnâtre,
the German detachment succeeded in deceiving
the enemy in regard to its weakness. The latter
marched and counter-marched, and also brought up
artillery, but did not attempt an attack, and remained
at Mory.</p>

<p>The 30th German Brigade and the 3rd Cavalry Division
assembled for the night in and about Bapaume.
The 29th Brigade occupied the neighbouring villages on
the right and the left of the Arras road.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Battle of Bapaume.</span>&mdash;<i>January 3rd.</i>&mdash;General Faidherbe
had brought his forces close up to the position
which covered the investment of Péronne. His four
Divisions consisted of fifty-seven battalions, which were
opposed by only seventeen German battalions. He
decided on the 3rd to push on in four columns to
Grévillers and Biefvillers, on the high road, and to
Favreuil on the east.</p>

<p>But General von Goeben was not inclined to give up
his position at Bapaume. Under cover of a force in occupation
of Favreuil, General von Kummer in the morning
assembled the 30th Brigade in front of Bapaume, and
behind it the 29th, of which, however, three battalions
were left in the villages to left and to right. A
reserve was established further to the rear at Tronsloy,
whither the 8th Rifle Battalion, with two batteries, was
detached; and General von Barnekow received orders to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
hold three battalions and the 2nd Foot Detachment in
readiness at Sailly Saillisel, without raising the blockade.
Finally the detachment under Prince Albrecht, jun.&mdash;three
battalions, eight squadrons, and three batteries&mdash;advanced
on Bertincourt, near to the subsequent battle-field.
In this disposition, in bitterly cold and sullen
weather, the attack of the French was awaited.</p>

<p>General Count von der Groeben had already sent the
7th Cavalry Brigade against the enemy's right flank,
but it did not succeed in forcing its way through the
villages occupied by the hostile infantry.</p>

<p>On the right wing the Division Robin was at Beugnâtre
met by so sharp a fire from two battalions of the
65th Regiment and two horse batteries which had joined
them from Transloy, that it withdrew again on Mory.
The garrison of Favreuil was reinforced by two battalions
and two batteries against the approach of the Division
Payen, which was marching by the high road to the
eastward of that place. The first French gun moving
out from Sapignies was immediately destroyed, but
several batteries soon became engaged on both sides,
and the French forced their way into Favreuil and
St. Aubin.</p>

<p>The 40th Regiment advanced on these places at noon
from Bertincourt, and after a lively action re-occupied
them; but had to evacuate Favreuil again, and took up
a position alongside of the 2nd Guard Uhlan regiment
and a horse battery sideward of Frémicourt, which
secured the right flank of the Division.</p>

<p>On the left, the Division Bessol had driven the weak
garrison out of Biefvillers. The 1st Battalion of the
33rd Regiment, which moved forward to retake that
place, became hotly engaged; it lost all but three of
its officers, and had to retire upon Avesnes. The Division
Derroja also took part in this fight. The French
now brought up a strong force of artillery, and extended
their firing-line to the south nearly as far as the road
to Albert.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, at mid-day, General von Kummer decided
to confine himself to the local defence of Bapaume. At
the cost of serious loss, the artillery covered the drawing
in thither of the infantry. The 1st Heavy Battery,
which was the last to withdraw, lost 2 officers, 17 men,
and 36 horses; its guns could only be brought out of
action with the help of the infantry.</p>

<p>In Bapaume the 29th Brigade now prepared for an
obstinate defence of the old city wall, and the 30th
assembled behind the place. The French advanced
leisurely as far as the suburb. Then ensued a long pause
in the fighting. General Faidherbe hoped to take the
town by further encompassing it, without exposing it
to a bombardment followed by a storm. A brigade of
the Division Derroja endeavoured to advance through
Tilloy, but met there with stubborn resistance from
the Rifle Battalion and two batteries which had come up
from Péronne. At the same time twenty-four guns of
the batteries which had retired behind Bapaume opened
fire on the advancing columns, which then withdrew, at
half-past three, across the road to Albert. They soon
resumed the attack, and succeeded in entering Tilloy.
All the neighbouring batteries now opened fire upon this
village. General von Mirus, who on the advance of the
3rd Cavalry Division had been left behind in Miraumont,
saw no enemy in his front there, but heard the fighting
at Bapaume, and advanced from the west, as did
General von Strubberg from the town, to renew the
attack. The French did not await their arrival, and
were driven back out of the suburb and also Avesnes.
The French Divisions spent the night at Grévillers,
Bihucourt, Favreuil, and Beugnâtre, thus surrounding
Bapaume on three sides. The day had cost the Germans
52 officers and 698 men, and the French 53 officers and
2066 men.</p>

<p>But only by exerting the whole available strength
of the VIIIth Corps had it been possible to withstand
the preponderating attack of the enemy. It had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
not yet been possible to replenish the Corps' supply of
ammunition, and General von Goeben decided to
immediately move back the fighting ground to behind
the Somme. This movement was actually in process
when the patrols brought information that the enemy
was also evacuating the neighbouring villages.</p>

<p>The French troops, as yet unaccustomed to the
vicissitudes of warfare, had suffered extremely from
the previous day's fighting and the severe cold of the
ensuing night. General Faidherbe could perceive that
the forces before Péronne had been brought forward to
Bapaume, and that the Germans thus reinforced would
take the offensive. His chief object, the interruption
of the siege of Péronne, had been obtained, and the
General thought it best not to endanger that result by
a second encounter. He led his Corps back in the
direction of Arras. Of the German cavalry detachments
following up the retirement the 8th Cuirassiers
succeeded in breaking a French square. The 15th
Division withdrew behind the Somme, immediately
below Péronne, and the Saxon cavalry joined the right
wing at St. Quentin.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fighting on the Lower Seine.</span>&mdash;<i>January 4th.</i>&mdash;Exactly
at the same time the other Corps of the Ist
Army was in conflict with the enemy on the Lower
Seine. The French had not undertaken any new enterprise
on the right bank of the river, but on the left bank
they held the wooded heights of Bois de la Londe,
which overhang the southern outlet of the Seine after
its encircling the peninsula of Grand Couronne. Here
General von Bentheim,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> with a view of gaining room
in this direction, had assembled half the Ist Army
Corps, and advanced on the 4th of January on Les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Moulineaux. Before daybreak Lieut.-Colonel von
Hüllessem surprised the enemy's outposts there, stormed
the rock-crowned fortalice of Château Robert le Diable,
and took prisoners the defenders who had sought
refuge amid the ruins of the castle. The heights of
Maison Brulet were then scaled under the heavy fire
of the enemy, and two of his guns were taken. After a
renewed resistance at St. Ouen the French withdrew on
Bourgachard in the afternoon, pursued towards six in
the evening by a half squadron of dragoons, two guns,
and a company carried on waggons, which took from
them two 12-pounders posted at the entrance of Rougemontier,
killing the gunners and capturing an ammunition
waggon.</p>

<p>After a slight skirmish the enemy was also driven
out of Bourgtheroulde and thrown back in the direction
of Brionne. The French right wing at Elbeuf
during the night hastily withdrew from a position
rendered precarious by the wavering of the other detachments.
The affair cost 5 officers and 160 men.
The loss of the French must have been equal, besides
which they lost 300 prisoners and 4 guns.</p>

<p>General Roye posted his troops behind the Rille on
the line Pont-Audemer&mdash;Brionne, but the Germans
now held Bourgachard, Bourgtheroulde, and Elbeuf
strongly garrisoned, with three battalions at Grand-Couronne
in readiness to furnish support. The other
troops returned to Rouen. An attempted advance of
the French on the same day by the northern bank of
the Seine had been arrested in front of Fauville, whence
they again withdrew towards Harfleur.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it had not escaped the observation of the
VIIIth Army Corps that this time the French did not
seek the cover of the northern fortresses, but that
they had halted south of Arras, thus betraying an intention
shortly to renew the attack on the force investing
Péronne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>General von Goeben therefore decided to return to
the northern bank of the Somme, to cover that operation,
and there to take up a flanking position whose
front the enemy would have to cross in his advance.</p>

<p>On January 6th, after the troops had been permitted
one day's rest and the ammunition had been replenished,
the 30th Brigade moved to Bray, the 29th to Albert.
In close vicinity to the enemy was the 3rd Cavalry
Division at Bapaume, behind it the Guard Cavalry
Brigade. For the protection of the left flank Lieut.-Colonel
von Pestel<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> occupied Acheux, and from the
investing Corps the 3rd Reserve Division moved westward
of Péronne to Feuillères. The Corps-Artillery
remained for the time on the left bank of the Somme,
since it almost seemed as if the enemy intended to direct
his attack on Amiens.</p>

<p>But during the next day the French did not undertake
anything of importance, and on the 9th Péronne
fell.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Reduction of Péronne.</span>&mdash;<i>January 9th.</i>&mdash;For fourteen
days this little place had been invested by eleven battalions,
sixteen squadrons, and ten batteries. Flooded
meadows on one side, and on the other walls with
medieval towers, had secured it against a surprise;
but for the rest it was commanded on all sides by
overhanging heights.</p>

<p>Although the fire of fifty-eight field guns had not
done it much damage, yet in any case it must have
been very soon discontinued for want of ammunition.
A bombardment with captured French siege-artillery
remained without result. The fortress stoutly maintained
its fire, and its garrison of only 3500 men even
attempted sorties.</p>

<p>As before mentioned, on the day of the battle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Bapaume, a portion of the besieging troops had been
necessarily withdrawn to the support of the VIIIth
Army Corps, and in the uncertainty as to the result of
this fight it had been imperative to take precautions for
the safety of the siege material. The troops that remained
behind stood ready to march, and part of the
heavy guns had been withdrawn. But the garrison
maintained a waiting attitude.</p>

<p>Two days later arrived a siege-train of fifty-five
heavy guns which had been brought together at La
Fère. A second, of twenty-eight French siege-pieces,
was on the way from Mézières. The preliminaries of a
regular siege were undertaken, and when at length on
the 8th of January a large ammunition-convoy arrived,
the commandant was summoned to give up a defence
that had now become hopeless.</p>

<p>On the 10th of January, General von Barnekow
entered the fortress, which was found amply provided
with arms, ammunition and provisions. The garrison
were made prisoners.</p>

<p>On the 7th of January, his Majesty the King had
assigned General von Manteuffel to another section of
the theatre of war, and had given the supreme command
of the Ist Army to General von Goeben.</p>

<p>Freed from concern as to Péronne, that General's
only duty thenceforward was to insure the protection of
the investment of Paris. For this purpose the Somme,
whose passages were all in the hands of the Germans,
formed a natural bulwark, behind which the attack even
of a greatly superior enemy could be awaited. And
some reinforcements now arrived for the VIIIth Army
Corps. The peaceful condition of the Lower Seine
allowed of two infantry regiments and two batteries
being sent from thence to Amiens. By instructions from
the supreme Head-quarter an infantry brigade of the
Meuse Army was held in readiness, which in case of need
was to be sent up by rail to reinforce the Ist Army.</p>

<p>It was still uncertain whither the enemy would direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
his stroke. General von Goeben, therefore, spread his
forces behind the Somme on a prolonged extension of
some forty-five miles, still holding fast the points gained
in front of the river, to meet the contingency of his
having to renew the offensive. In the middle of the
month, the detachments of the Ist Corps under the command
of General Count von der Groeben occupied
Amiens, Corbie, and the line of the Hallue as a flank
position. The 15th Division, holding Bray firmly, took
up quarters south of that village. Next to it, on the left
of Péronne, was the 3rd Reserve Division, right of it
were the 16th Division and the 3rd Reserve Cavalry
Brigade, holding Roisel and Vermand to the front.
The 12th Cavalry Division was at St. Quentin.</p>

<p>The French army had already begun to advance on
the Cambrai high-road, and its XXIInd Corps had
pushed back the 3rd Cavalry Division first out of
Bapaume and then out of Albert behind the Hallue.
The XXIIIrd followed by the same road, and their
objective really appears to have been Amiens. But a
reconnaissance had exposed the difficulty of attacking
in that direction, besides which a telegram from the
War Minister announced that the Army of Paris within
the next few days was to make a last supreme effort to
burst the bonds of the investment, and the Army of the
North was enjoined to divert, as far as possible, the
enemy's forces from the capital, and draw them on itself.</p>

<p>In accordance with these orders General Faidherbe
decided to advance without delay on St. Quentin,
whither the Brigade Isnard was already marching from
Cambrai. An attack on their right wing, consisting
for the time solely of cavalry, directly threatened the
communications of the Germans, while the vicinity of
the northern forts afforded the French army shelter
and also greater liberty of action.</p>

<p>But General von Goeben had foreseen such a leftward
movement of the enemy, and concentrated all his
forces to meet it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>The convalescents who were fit for service joined the
ranks. Only weak detachments were left at Amiens,
and because of the approach of the XIIIth Corps from
the Sarthe to the Lower Seine, it was now safe to transfer
the 3rd Grenadier Regiment and a heavy battery
from thence to the Somme.</p>

<p>The departure of the French from Albert and the
march of their Corps on Combles and Sailly Saillisel
were soon reported by the cavalry in observation.
The newly-formed Brigade Pauly occupied Bapaume,
and the Brigade Isnard entered St. Quentin, whence
General zur Lippe (commanding the 12th (Saxon)
Cavalry Division detailed from the Army of the Meuse)
retired on Ham in accordance with orders. General
von Goeben now moved eastward, using the roads on
both banks of the Somme so that he might the sooner
reach the enemy.</p>

<p><i>January 17th.</i>&mdash;The 12th Cavalry Brigade moved
further to the right on La Fère, the 16th Division to
Ham. The 3rd Reserve Division and the Guard
Cavalry Brigade arrived at Nesle; the 15th Division and
the Corps Artillery, at Villers Carbonnel. An Army-Reserve
had been formed of the troops last brought up
from Rouen, and it followed to Harbonnières. On the
northern bank, the detachment under Count von der
Groeben moved to the vicinity of Péronne.</p>

<p>The four French Divisions had so far advanced on
Vermand as to be able to unite next day near St.
Quentin. The XXIIIrd Corps was to move straight
upon the town, the XXIInd to cross the Somme lower
down, and take up a position south of St. Quentin.</p>

<p><i>January 18th.</i>&mdash;On the German side, the 16th and
the 3rd Reserve Division moved by the south bank of
the Somme to Jussy and Flavy, the Army-Reserve to
Ham. The 12th Cavalry Division at Vendeuil found
the country east of the Oise still free from the enemy.</p>

<p>With the object of obtaining touch of the approaching
enemy, the 15th Division was on its part to cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the Somme at Brie, and, together with the troops of
General Count von der Groeben, to advance on Vermand
and Etreillers. General von Kummer was enjoined, in
case he found that the French had taken up a position,
merely to watch them and to follow them should they
retire northward, but should they march towards the
south, to attack them with all his force.</p>

<p>At half-past ten, the 29th Brigade came up on the
hither side of Tertry with the rear-guard of the XXIInd
Corps and its trains. The Hussars charged one of the
battalions guarding the latter, and drove the waggons
in the greatest disorder back on Caulaincourt, but had
to abandon prisoners and prize under the fire of the
approaching infantry. The French brigade had turned
about, and it advanced to an attack on Trescon. This
was resisted by the 65th Regiment and three batteries
until after two o'clock, when General du Bessol
reached the scene of the fight and ordered the French
brigade to resume its march on St. Quentin.</p>

<p>The XXIIIrd had also halted and detached a brigade
against the left flank of the 15th Division. This, however,
on reaching Cauvigny Farm, came upon two
German battalions, which after a protracted fire-fight
pursued the retreating enemy and entered Caulaincourt
at half-past three, making 100 prisoners and capturing
fourteen provision-waggons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Count von der Groeben had hurried
forward at the sound of firing. The General realized
that he could help most efficaciously by marching
straight on Vermand. Four batteries came into action
against P&oelig;uilly, which was occupied by the enemy, and
when the 4th Grenadier Regiment passed to the assault
the French retreated, losing some prisoners. Many
Gardes-Mobiles were dispersed by the Uhlans. About
Vermand the whole of the XXIIIrd Corps was now in
the act of beginning to march off.</p>

<p>Count von der Groeben therefore posted his troops
behind the P&oelig;uilly bottom, thereby retarding the withdrawal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of the enemy by forcing him to halt and form front
against each display of pressure. The 15th Division
took up quarters about Beauvois and Caulaincourt.</p>

<p>The sole aim of the French Generals on this day
seemed to be to reach St. Quentin. They neglected
the opportunity of falling with their two Corps upon
the single 15th Division. The XXIIIrd Corps passed
the night in and westward of St. Quentin, and the
XXIInd, after crossing the Somme at Séraucourt,
southward of the town. A further advance either on
Paris or on the German lines of communications depended
now, when the latter had approached so close,
on the issue of a battle; and this General Faidherbe
wished to await at St. Quentin.</p>

<p>It was important to hold on here in case the sortie of
the Paris Army should result in success. The ground
offered certain advantages&mdash;the heights in front of the
town gave a free range of fire and afforded a sheltered
position for the reserves. It was true that the Somme
divided the army in two halves, but the bridge of St.
Quentin made mutual assistance possible. The enemy
also occupied both sides of the river, and including the
Isnard and Pauly Brigades which had come up, he finally
counted 40,000 men, opposed to an enemy numerically
weaker.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The Germans, all told, numbered exactly
32,580 combatants, of whom nearly 6000 were cavalry.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of St. Quentin.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(January 19th.)</div>


<p>General von Goeben had ordered the general attack
for this day.</p>

<p>Covered by the occupation of Séraucourt, General
von Barnekow advanced along the southern bank of
the Somme, with the 16th and the 3rd Reserve Divisions
from Jussy through Essigny; the 12th Cavalry
Division advanced on the road leading from La Fère.</p>

<p>The French columns were still on the march to take
up their position with its rear towards the town; and
Grugies was already occupied by them. While the
32nd German Brigade advanced northward of Essigny
the Reserve Division halted behind the village, and the
31st Brigade at a quarter to ten advanced on Grugies.</p>

<p>This attack was taken in flank on its left by the
French Brigade Gislain, which had meanwhile occupied
the hamlets of Contescourt and Castres. It was met in
front by the Brigades Foerster and Pittié which had
promptly come into action.</p>

<p>The fire of the German batteries was at once
returned vigorously from Le Moulin de Tout Vent.
At eleven o'clock the second battalion of the 69th
Regiment marched in company columns across the
entirely open ground against the heights on the hither
side of Grugies; but the attempt, renewed four times,
was frustrated by the destructive cross-fire of the enemy.
The ammunition of the isolated battalion was nearly
exhausted, and only when followed by six fresh companies
of the 29th Regiment did it succeed in forcing
the French back, after a desperate hand-to-hand fight:
but the latter held their ground in front of Grugies
and in the sugar-factory there.</p>

<p>On the right wing, the 12th Cavalry Division were advancing
on the La Fère road. The French Brigade
Aynès, hitherto held in reserve, rushed forward at the
double to encounter it, and as Count zur Lippe had at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
disposition but one battalion of infantry, his advance at
first was arrested at Cornet d'Or. But when at noon the
Division was joined by reinforcements from Tergnier,
the Saxon rifles stormed the park by the high-road,
and the Schleswig-Holstein Fusiliers carried La Neuville.
The French, with the loss of many prisoners,
were vigorously pursued back to the suburb of St.
Quentin, where first they found shelter.</p>

<p>Meantime, the 31st Brigade was engaged in a hot
fight on both sides of the railway-line in front of Grugies;
behind its right wing was the 32nd in the hollow ground
on the high-road, where it suffered severely from the
enemy's shell-fire; and on the left, the detachment
advancing from Séraucourt did not succeed in entering
Contescourt. And now the French made so determined
and overwhelming an attack from Grugies, that the
16th Division had to be withdrawn as far as Essigny.</p>

<p>When after noon General Faidherbe joined the
XXIIIrd Corps, he had reason to hope that the XXIInd
Corps would be able to maintain its position. But
certainly the most important result was to be looked
for on the northern section of the battle-field.</p>

<p>Here the Division Robin had taken up a position between
Fayet and Francilly. The Brigade Isnard had
marched up it on its left, and the Brigade Lagrange of
the Division Payen extended as far as the Somme. The
Brigade Michelet remained in reserve, and the Brigade
Pauly at Gricourt secured the communications rearward.</p>

<p>On the German left, so early as eight o'clock, General
Count von der Groeben set out from P&oelig;uilly with eight
battalions and twenty-eight guns and advanced along
the Roman road; the Cavalry Brigade accompanied the
march on the left.</p>

<p>The East-Prussians<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> immediately hurled the French
back from Holnon, cleared them out of Selency, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
then advanced against Fayet and on to the heights of
Moulin Coutte. A gun in action, ammunition-waggons,
and many prisoners were there taken from the enemy.</p>

<p>By degrees the twenty-eight guns were massed on
the Windmill Height and entered into a contest with
the artillery of the Division Robin. But in the course
of half an hour the ammunition failed, since the waggons
which had been sent on the previous day to the
ammunition column of the VIIIth Corps had not yet
come up with the reserve supply. The batteries, which
were moreover suffering from infantry fire, had to
retire to Holnon, and as Francilly, immediately on the
flank and to the rear, was still occupied by the enemy,
a further advance was temporarily postponed.</p>

<p>On the right, General von Kummer with the 15th
Division, marching from Beauvois, had reached Etreillers
at ten. The King's Hussars cut in upon the
enemy's horse in retreat, and drove them back upon
L'Epine de Dallon, and the 29th Brigade entered Savy.
North of that place three batteries opened fire against
the artillery of the Division Payen, and then the 65th
Regiment passed to the attack of the forward-lying
copses. The smaller one to the south was carried, but
here, as at Francilly, the Brigade Isnard maintained
itself in the larger one to the north.</p>

<p>At noon the Brigade Lagrange also advanced once
more on the small copse and forced its way into it for a
short time, but was again driven back by the 65th.</p>

<p>The 33rd Regiment was posted in readiness on the
threatened right flank of the 29th Brigade, and near it
stood in action two heavy batteries of the Corps
Artillery just arrived at Savy. At the same time the
30th Brigade also advanced through Roupy on the right
of the 29th.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Colonel von Massow at one o'clock renewed
the offensive on the much more advanced left wing.
Six companies of the 44th Regiment advanced on
Fayet, and after firing into them at the shortest range,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
drove the French from the place. Two batteries followed,
and resumed action against the enemy's great
artillery position at Moulin de Cépy.</p>

<p>General Paulze D'Ivoy, who saw the communications
of his Corps with Cambrai in such imminent danger, had
already called up the Brigade Michelet from its reserve
post west of the town, and thus reinforced now advanced
on Fayet. The Prussian detachments that were in the
place had to be withdrawn to Moulin Coutte; but the
further advance of the enemy towards these heights
was arrested by a flank attack from Selency, and at
the same time the farmstead of Bois des Roses was
carried. The French again withdrew on Fayet.</p>

<p>There, at Francilly, and in the northern copses, they
still held their own at half-past one, while at that hour,
on the German side, all three brigades had been
brought up into the fighting-line. The Army-Reserve
had arrived from Ham at Roupy, but General von
Goeben, who from the latter place had been watching
the slow progress of the 16th Division, had already
sent it at eleven o'clock through Séraucourt to the
support of that Division.</p>

<p>Colonel von Boecking (commanding the Army-Reserve),
with his three battalions, three squadrons, and
two batteries, advanced from Séraucourt against Contescourt.
Hastening forward with the cavalry, he brought
his artillery promptly into action; and then the 41st
Regiment, immediately on its arrival, passed to the
attack. The battalion of the 19th Regiment which was
already on the spot, joined in the fighting, and the
enemy with the loss of many prisoners, was at one o'clock
driven out of Contescourt and of Castres as well, towards
the heights of Grugies. Against these heights the fire
of the artillery, which had gradually been increased to
thirty guns, was now directed.</p>

<p>Bent on further disputing the position, General
Lecomte brought up several battalions from the brigades
of Pittié and Aynès for the reinforcement of the Brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Gislain. The East-Prussian Regiment (41st) succeeded,
nevertheless, by half-past two o'clock, in hurling the
enemy by an outflanking attack from the heights into
the hollow in front of Grugies. Colonel von Boecking's
vigorous attack made itself felt throughout the whole
front of fight.</p>

<p>With a view to renewing a general advance, General
von Barnekow had ordered up his last reserves from
Essigny, when towards three o'clock the Brigade Pittié
unexpectedly pushed forward an attack along the railway
line. Its right scourged by artillery fire from
Castres, it found its left taken at unawares by the
charge of five squadrons of reserve cavalry from the
Urvilliers hollow. Simultaneously Colonel von Hartzberg
advanced with the 32nd Brigade, and drove the
enemy back to Moulin de Tout Vent.</p>

<p>The Brigade Foerster, south of Grugies, had still held
out stubbornly, although now seriously threatened on
the right from Giffécourt, as well as by the 12th Cavalry
Division on its left flank. Its left flank now completely
uncovered by the retreat of the Brigade Pittié, and its
last strength exhausted by a long struggle, the brigade
found itself finally forced to evacuate its long-held
position. The 31st Brigade advanced along the railway-line
as far as the sugar-factory, and Colonel von
Boecking drove the last French detachments out of
Grugies. He then prepared with his artillery the attack
upon Moulin de Tout Vent. Against these heights the
41st Regiment, the battalions already ordered up from
Essigny, and the 32nd Brigade advanced to a concentric
attack. The French did not prolong their resistance,
and indeed were already in retreat. The entire German
fighting line, with the 12th Cavalry Division on its
right, moved forward on the town, which was now
reached by the fire of the artillery posted at
Gauchy. The cavalry repeatedly broke in on the
retreating hostile bodies; and the railway-station and
suburb, in which was found only the rear-guard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the XXth French Corps, was occupied after a short
struggle.</p>

<p>Whilst on the southern section of the battle-field the
action took this turn, on the northern side the attacks
were also being pushed.</p>

<p>By two o'clock the 28th Regiment advancing from
Roupy by the road from Ham had carried the farmstead
of L'Epine de Dallon; and almost simultaneously
Count von der Groeben's infantry came up to renew
the offensive.</p>

<p>Whilst on the right some companies of the 4th and
44th Regiments opposed the advance of French detachments
from the larger copse, Major von Elpons with
six companies of the Crown Prince Grenadiers, advanced
from Holnon and Selency upon Francilly, and,
notwithstanding the hot fire of the defenders, forced an
entrance into this very straggling village, in which
many prisoners were made. As, however, the East-Prussian
Regiment then advanced further south of the
Roman road, it had in its turn to sustain a formidable
attack.</p>

<p>To cover its threatened line of retreat, the Brigade
Michelet once more advanced from Fayet, and the
Brigade Pauly also marched from Gricourt upon Moulin
Coutte. This position, which had in the meantime
been strengthened by artillery, was, however, obstinately
held by the 44th Regiment, and when the
Grenadier companies poured in leftward towards the
Roman road, the enemy's attack was here also repulsed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 29th Brigade, followed by the 30th,
had already advanced in the direction of St. Quentin, the
33rd Regiment on its right and the 65th Regiment on the
left. The latter regiment now took complete possession
of the larger copse, and forty-eight guns were brought
up on both sides of the road from Savy. The further
advance of the infantry was effected in column of companies
and on an extended line, because of the heavy
shell fire of the French. The Brigades of Lagrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
and Isnard did not await the shock, but at four o'clock
retired on St. Quentin with the loss of one gun.</p>

<p>Their artillery once more took up a position at
Rocourt, but at five o'clock had to abandon it abruptly,
and the French now confined themselves to the defence
of the barricaded accesses into the St. Martin suburb of
St. Quentin.</p>

<p>Six Prussian batteries were brought up against
these, and the 29th Brigade for some time maintained
a stationary fire fight on the strongly held buildings and
gardens; but presently several companies from Rocourt
established themselves in the suburb, in which street-fighting
was still continued, even after Lieutenant-Colonel
von Hüllessem had succeeded in crossing the
canal bridge and entering the town itself.</p>

<p>By four o'clock, General Faidherbe had already the
conviction that the XXIIIrd Corps would probably be
unable to hold its ground. In this event his choice
was limited to the alternative of a night retreat, or of
being shut up in St. Quentin. He had not yet formed
a decision, when he met in the town General Lecointe,
who reported that he had abandoned the defence of
the left bank of the Somme. Thanks to the resistance
still maintained by the XXIIIrd Corps on the north,
the XXIInd was enabled to retire unmolested on Le
Cateau.</p>

<p>The Commanding General now ordered General
Paulze d'Ivoy to retire on that place, but the latter
only received the order at six in the evening, when
the brigades of the right wing&mdash;Pauly's and Michelet's&mdash;had
already started of their own accord for
Cambrai. The more obstinately the two remaining
brigades now defended the suburb of St. Martin, the
more ominous for them must prove the result of the
action. Attacked in rear by the battalions of Colonel
von Boecking, the greater portion were made prisoners.
The 41st Regiment alone took prisoners 54 officers and
2260 men, besides capturing 4 guns. General Faidherbe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
himself only escaped the same fate by the help of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>The action ended at half-past six in the evening,
and the troops passed the night in the town and in
the captured villages.</p>

<p>The hard-won victory had cost the Germans 96
officers and 2304 men; 3000 wounded Frenchmen
were found on the battle-field, and the number of
unwounded prisoners exceeded 9000.</p>

<p>According to theory, the pursuit should invariably
clinch the victory&mdash;a postulate assented to by all, and
particularly by civilians; and yet in practice it is
seldom observed. Military history furnishes but few
instances, such as the famous one of Belle Alliance.
It requires a very strong and pitiless will to impose
fresh exertions and dangers upon troops who have
marched, fought and fasted for ten or twelve hours,
in place of the longed-for rest and food. But even
given the possession of this will, the question of pursuit
will yet depend on the circumstances under which the
victory has been won. It will be difficult of execution
when all the bodies on the field of battle, as at Königgrätz,
have become so intermixed that hours are
required to re-form them into tactical cohesion; or
when, as at St. Quentin, all, even the troops last thrown
into the action, have become so entangled that not one
single tactically complete body of infantry remains at
disposition. Without the support of such a body,
cavalry at night will be seriously detained before every
obstacle and each petty post of the enemy, and thus
alone its exertions will rarely be repaid.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>
<p>General von Goeben did not pursue the defeated
enemy till the following day. His advanced cavalry
ranged up to the suburb of Cambrai and the glacis
of Landrecies, without meeting with any resistance,
and merely brought in some hundreds of stragglers.
The Infantry Divisions followed to within four miles of
Cambrai. Against this fortress nothing could be undertaken
through want of siege material, and there was
no military advantage to be derived in extending
further north. Among the news to hand it was
reported that a considerable portion of the French
Army of the North had retired upon Lille, Douai and
Valenciennes. As fresh enterprises on its part were
consequently not to be expected, General von Goeben
brought his force back to the Somme, where towards
the end of the month it took up rest quarters between
Amiens and St. Quentin.</p>

<p>On the Lower Seine, the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg
entered Rouen with the XIIIth Corps on the
25th, after having encountered on the march only a
few franctireurs. Although General Loysel had increased
his force to a strength of nearly 30,000 by
reinforcements from Cherbourg, he had remained
entirely inactive.</p>

<p>General von Goeben had in view the transfer to the
Army of the Somme of that portion of the Ist Corps
still about Rouen; but this was disapproved of by
telegram from the supreme Head-quarter, which on
political grounds ordered its continued retention there.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Occurrences in the South-Eastern Seat of
War up to 17th of January.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Siege of Belfort.</span>&mdash;In the south-eastern theatre
of war, the forces detailed to operate against Belfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
had been only gradually brought together under cover
of the XIVth Army Corps.</p>

<p>The town is surrounded by a bastioned enceinte.
The citadel has a wide command, built as it is on lofty
rocks, which, to increase the development of fire, are
encircled by successive tiers of works in terrace-formation.
On the left bank of the Savoureuse, newly constructed
lines of defence protected the suburb and railway
station. On the high adjacent ridge to the north-east
the forts of La Miotte and La Justice, with the
enclosing lines connecting them with the main fortress,
formed a spacious intrenched camp. Hostile occupation
of the lofty eminences of the two Perches (Hautes
and Basses) would certainly endanger the whole defensive
position, dominating as they did even the citadel
from the south at a distance of only 1100 yards, and
whence the works on the left bank of the river could
be brought under fire. But two forts of masonry
had been constructed on the Perches before the advent
of the enemy, and further to strengthen the defence
the nearest copses and villages, as for instance Pérouse
and Danjoutin, had been intrenched.</p>

<p>The fortress was by no means deficient in bomb-proof
accommodation. Its armament consisted of 341
heavy guns, and it was provisioned for five months.</p>

<p>When immediately after the opening of the campaign,
the VIIth French Corps vacated Alsace, only about
5000 Gardes-Mobiles remained in Belfort, but its
garrison, increased by calling in National Guards, now
exceeded 17,000.</p>

<p>The vigilant Commandant, Colonel Denfert, laid
great stress on the maintenance in force of the environs
in his front. The advanced posts were every day
assigned to fresh operations, which the artillery of the
fortress had to cover at extreme ranges.</p>

<p>On the opposite side, General von Tresckow (commanding
1st Reserve Division) had available at the
outset, a force of not more than twenty weak battalions
of Landwehr, five squadrons and six field-batteries, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
all barely 15,000 men. He had at first to confine himself
to a mere investment. The troops, intrenched in
the villages round a wide circumference, had to repel
many sorties.</p>

<p>Orders were received from the supreme Headquarter
to set about the regular siege of the place.
General von Mertens was charged with the direction
of the engineer operations, and Lieut.-Col. Scheliha
with that of the artillery attack. The difficulties
of the undertaking were obvious. The rocky nature
of the soil could not but increase the labour of
throwing up earthworks, and the cold season was
approaching. The attack could be carried on successfully
only from the south against the main work&mdash;the
formidable citadel. Only fifty heavy guns were
available for the time, and the infantry strength was
not sufficient to efficiently invest the place on all
sides.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, there devolved on General
von Tresckow the task of attempting the reduction
of Belfort by a mere bombardment. Towards
this purpose the attack was chiefly directed from
the west, in which quarter, after the enemy's garrison
had been driven out of Valdoye, the infantry occupied
Essert and Bavilliers, as well as the adjacent wooded
heights. On December 2nd seven batteries were constructed
on the plateau between these two villages by
3000 men, under cover of two battalions. The hard-frozen
ground added to the difficulties of the work;
yet, notwithstanding the moonlight night, the operations
would appear to have escaped the attention of
the besieged. When on the following morning the sun
had dispersed the fog and made visible the objects, fire
was opened.</p>

<p>The fortress replied at first but feebly, but afterwards
with increasing vigour from the entire line of works,
even from Forts La Miotte and La Justice at a range
of 4700 yards, and the losses in the trenches were
considerable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Four more batteries in front of Bavilliers were
armed, and on the fall of La Tuilerie the infantry
pressed on to within 170 yards of the enemy's most
advanced trenches. The artillery fire caused a conflagration
in the town; but the ammunition was soon
exhausted, whilst the lofty citadel maintained unchecked
an effective fire, and repeated sorties on the
part of the garrison had to be repelled. It was now
clear, since no decisive result had followed the methods
hitherto resorted to, that only by a regular attack could
that be attained.</p>

<p>On the south Colonel von Ostrowski on December
13th had carried the French positions of Adelnans and
the wooded heights of Le Bosmont and La Brosse. On
the eastern point of the latter two batteries, and on
its northern skirt four additional batteries had been
thrown up, not without great difficulty arising from
thaw having made the ground a swamp. On January
7th, fifty guns opened fire. The superiority of the
artillery of the attack was soon manifest. Fort
Bellevue suffered severely, and notably the fire from
Basses Perches was entirely silenced.</p>

<p>But it was of grave importance that the village
of Danjoutin, strongly garrisoned and intrenched by
the enemy, stood in the way of a further advance.
During the night of the 8th January seven companies
attacked this position, and also from the northward at
the same time took possession of the railway-embankment.
With empty rifles the Landwehr hurled themselves
against the enemy in the face of a hot fire, and
charged along the village street up to the church. The
supports hastening from the fortress were driven back
at the railway-embankment, but the fight about the
buildings in the southern quarter of the village lasted
till towards noon. Of the defenders, twenty officers and
700 men were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Typhus and small-pox had broken out in Belfort;
and in the besieging force also the number of the sick
reached a considerable figure, caused by arduous work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
in inclement weather. Most of the battalions could
only muster 500 men, and this weakness led General
von Tresckow to devote half his force to the lighter
duty of protecting the investment from without, principally
towards the south.</p>

<p>Trustworthy intelligence estimated the French
strength at Besançon at 62,000. Although hitherto entirely
inactive, this force now seemed in strong earnest to
press on to the relief of the hard-pressed fortress by the
line of the Doubs. On this line was the fortified château
of Montbéliard, held by one German battalion, and armed
with heavy guns. Between the Doubs and the Swiss
frontier about Delle stood General Debschitz with eight
battalions, two squadrons, and two batteries, and General
von Werder concentrated the XIVth Corps at Noroy,
Aillevans, and Athésans, to oppose with all his strength
any interruption of the siege of Belfort.</p>

<p>From January 5th onwards there ensued a series of
engagements in front of Vesoul, as the result of which
the enemy advanced from the south and west to within
four miles of that town. There could be no doubt that
very considerable forces were engaged in this advance.
East also of the Ognon, the enemy's posts were advanced
beyond Rougemont, although in lesser force. In these
actions 500 prisoners were made; and it was at once
evident that besides the XVIIIth, the XXIVth and
XXth Corps also formed part of Bourbaki's army; a
circumstance which threw a sudden light upon a totally
changed phase of the war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Transfer of the French Army of the East to the
South-Eastern Seat of War, end of December.</span>&mdash;As
had been expected by the supreme Headquarter at Versailles,
about the beginning of January an attempt had
been made to bring about combined action on the part
of Generals Chanzy and Bourbaki. As we have already
seen, the advance of the former had been thwarted by
Prince Frederick Charles on the Loir, and Bourbaki<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
had actually made preparations for an advance by Montargis
to the relief of Paris. But he delayed its execution
until the 19th December, when the IInd German Army
had already returned to Orleans from its expedition to
Le Mans. General Bourbaki had now to realize that
the IInd Army would fall on the flank of his projected
movement, and he thus the more readily concurred in
another plan, devised by the Delegate de Freycinet,
and approved of by the Dictator Gambetta.</p>

<p>This was for the XVth Corps to remain about Bourges
and to cover that town in intrenched positions about
Vierzon and Nevers; the XVIIIth and XXth were to
proceed to Beaune by railway, and, when raised to a
strength of 70,000 by an union with Garibaldi and
Crémer, to occupy Dijon. The newly-formed XXIVth
Corps was also to be moved by railway from Lyons to
Besançon, where, with the forces already there, a
strength of 50,000 would be attained. In co-operation
with the "invincibles of Dijon," it then would be
easy to raise the siege of Belfort "without even
striking a blow." It was expected that the mere
existence of this mass of considerably above 100,000
men would avert any attacks upon the Northern
fortresses; in any case, there was the certainty of
severing the enemy's various lines of communication,
and the later prospect also of combined action with
Faidherbe.</p>

<p>The railway transport of Bourbaki's army from the
Loir to the Saône had already commenced by December
23rd. In the absence of all preparations, many
interruptions and breaks-down in the traffic naturally
occurred, and the troops suffered severely from the
intense cold and from being insufficiently cared for.
When Chagny and Châlons sur Saône had been reached,
and it was ascertained that the Germans had already
evacuated Dijon, it was decided to again entrain the
troops so as to bring them nearer to Besançon; whence
arose a fresh delay, and it was only in the beginning of
the new year that the Army of the East stood in readiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
between Dijon and Besançon. The XVth Corps
was now also ordered thither, but fourteen days were
required for its transportation.</p>

<p>The comprehensive plan of M. Freycinet, and his
sanguine expectations, were essentially favoured by the
circumstance that the transfer of those great bodies of
troops to a remote section of the field of war had
remained concealed for a fortnight from the IInd
Army, as well as from the XIVth Corps, and consequently
from the chief Head-quarter. Rumours and
newspaper articles had no doubt given somewhat
earlier hints, but General von Werder's telegram of
January 5th was the first really authentic announcement
by which it was known beyond doubt that the
Germans now stood face to face with an entirely altered
aspect of the military situation. In Versailles the appropriate
dispositions and arrangements were promptly
made, and steps taken for the formation of a new Army
of the South.</p>

<p>There was available for this purpose the IInd Corps
at Montargis, and half of the VIIth under General von
Zastrow at Auxerre, which during this period of uncertainty
had been constantly moving to and fro between
the Saône and Yonne, according as the one or
the other quarter appeared to be threatened. The
chief command of these two Corps, to which was afterwards
added that of the XIVth, was entrusted to
General von Manteuffel. General von Werder could
not be immediately reinforced, and for a time the
XIVth Corps was thrown upon its own resources.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their superiority of strength, the
French did more man&oelig;uvring than fighting. General
Bourbaki aimed at outflanking the left wing of the
XIVth Corps, and thus entirely cutting it off from Belfort.
On January 5th the XVIIIth Corps advanced by
Grandvelle, and the XXth by Echenoz le Sec, on Vesoul;
but, as we have seen, they there met with opposition,
and as the XXIVth Corps sent to the right to Esprels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
learned that Villersexel was occupied by the Germans,
Bourbaki determined upon a still more easterly and
circuitous route. On the 8th the two Corps of the left
wing marched off to the right, the XVIIIth to Montbozon,
the XXth to Rougemont; the XXIVth went
back to Cuse. At the same time General Crémer
received orders to move from Dijon on Vesoul. On
the 9th the XXIVth and XXth Corps were at Vellechevreux
and Villargent on the Arcey-Villersexel road,
while the head of the XVIIIth Corps reached Villersexel
and Esprels.</p>

<p>General von Werder had no alternative but to
follow this sideward movement in all haste. He ordered
the Baden Division to Athésans, the 4th Reserve
Division to Aillevans, and Von der Goltz's Brigade
to Noroy le Bourg. The trains were put in march to
Lure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action of Villersexel</span>, January 9th.&mdash;Accordingly
at seven in the morning the Reserve Division was sent
on from Noroy to Aillevans, and began bridging the
Ognon to admit of the continuation of the march. A
flanking detachment of the 25th Regiment sent to the
right, was fired on near Villersexel, and the attempt to
carry the stone bridge at that place failed shortly after.
The French with two and a half battalions occupied
the town, situated on a height on the further bank of
the river. Shortly afterwards reinforcements came up
on the German side. Two batteries opened fire upon the
place and upon the still advancing bodies of the enemy.
The 25th Regiment crossed the river by the suspension
bridge and broke into the walled park and into the
château. At one o'clock the French were driven out
of the town with the loss of many prisoners, and a
pause in the fighting ensued.</p>

<p>The Prussian force during the fighting had been
seriously threatened on its flank by the advance from
Esprels of the 1st Division of the French XVIIIth Corps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
with the artillery-reserve. General von der Goltz,
however, opposed it by occupying the village of Moimay.
He also sent to Villersexel nine companies of the
30th Regiment, to relieve the 25th Regiment there, so
as to allow the latter to rejoin its own Division in the
further march. His combined brigade was eventually
to form the rear-guard of the whole movement.</p>

<p>General von Werder, who observed the considerable
force in which the French were advancing on Villersexel
from the south, concluded that there was less to
be gained by forcing his own passage across the
Ognon than by opposing that of the French, since
the river covered his line of approach to Belfort. He
therefore recalled the infantry already issuing to the
southward from the town, and withdrew the batteries
to the northern side of the river. Here the main body
of the 4th Reserve Division took up a defensive position,
and the Baden Division was called in on its
march at Arpenans and Lure, as a much-needed reinforcement
to the former.</p>

<p>It was already evening when large columns of the
French advanced on Villersexel and shelled the town.</p>

<p>Favoured by the darkness, they penetrated into the
park and château, from which the German garrison had
already been withdrawn; and as the general condition
of things did not seem to necessitate the occupation of
Villersexel, the responsible officers ordered the evacuation
of the town. Though hard pressed by the enemy,
this movement had been nearly completed, when
orders arrived from General von Werder to hold the
town.</p>

<p>At once four battalions from the Reserve Division
advanced to the renewed attack. The 25th Regiment
turned about at the bridge over the Ognon and joined
them. The Landwehr rushed into the ground floor of
the straggling château, but the French defended themselves
in the upper floors and the cellars. On the
staircase and in the passages of the already burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
buildings there ensued a hot and changeful combat, and
the fight was maintained in the streets. Not till the
General in command took the matter in hand, and himself
ordered it to be broken off, were dispositions made
at one o'clock in the morning for a gradual retirement,
which was completed by three. The Reserve Division
then recrossed the bridge at Aillevans, and occupied
St. Sulpice on the right.</p>

<p>General von der Goltz had held Moimay until
evening.</p>

<p>Of the XIVth Corps only 15,000 had been engaged,
of whom 26 officers and 553 men had fallen. The French
losses amounted to 27 officers and 627 men; and they
also left behind in the hands of the Germans 700 unwounded
prisoners. The French troops which chiefly
took part in the operations were the XVIIIth and
XXth Corps; the XXIVth Corps, on account of the
fighting in its rear, had suspended its march to
Arcey through Sevenans. Detachments of the gradually
incoming XVth Corps advanced from southward in
the direction of Belfort.</p>

<p>On the morning of January 10th, General von
Werder massed his Corps in the vicinity of Aillevans,
ready to engage the enemy should the latter attempt an
advance through Villersexel. But no attack was made,
and so the march could be resumed that same morning.
As a matter of fact, the French with three Corps were as
near to Belfort as the Germans were with three Divisions.
To cover the departure the Reserve Division
took up a position at Athésans, and on the following
day all the forces reached and occupied the line of
the Lisaine. On the right wing about Frahier and
Chalonvillars stood the Baden Division; in the centre,
the Reserve Brigade between Chagey and Couthenans;
on the left, the Reserve Division at Héricourt and
Tavey. On the south, General von Debschitz stood
in observation at Delle, and Colonel von Bredow at
Arcey; towards the west Colonel von Willisen was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Lure with the detachment of eight companies, thirteen
squadrons, two batteries, which had come up from
Vesoul.</p>

<p>General von Werder had in fact, succeeded in interposing
his force between the enemy and Belfort.</p>

<p>The French commander, under the intoxicating
impression of a victory, had resigned himself to inactivity.
"General Billot," he reported to the Government
at Bordeaux, "has occupied Esprels and maintains
himself there." We know that he was never
attacked there at all, and that he did not succeed in
driving away General von der Goltz from the vicinity
of Moimay. "General Clinchant has carried Villersexel
with extraordinary dash;" but the fight of the 9th
was, as regards the Germans, maintained with only a portion
of the XIVth Corps, to cover the right flank of the
main body on its march. Whilst, then, this movement
of the latter was prosecuted with the utmost energy,
the French army remained passive for two days, ready
for action and in the confident expectation that the
enemy described as beaten, would come on again to fight
for the supremacy. Not until the 13th did the XXIVth
Corps advance on Arcey, the XXth on Saulnot, and
the XVIIIth follow to Sevenans. The XVth was to
support an attack on Arcey by way of Ste. Marie.</p>

<p>General von Werder had utilized this interval, while
the troops were hastening forward, in ascertaining the
eligibility of the Lisaine position and in a consultation
with General von Tresckow in rear of it.</p>

<p>A detailed inspection showed that at Frahier the
Lisaine, there but an unimportant streamlet, flows
through a broad grassy hollow, and thence to Chagey
through steep wooded slopes. About Héricourt the
valley opens out into a wide plain, which is however
commanded by the rocky heights of Mont Vaudois.
Lower down the wooded heights line the river as far as
Montbéliard, which with the Allaine brook forms a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
strong point of support and the extremity of the
line.</p>

<p>The wooded character of the plain west of the Lisaine
would necessarily increase the assailants' difficulties in
the deployment of large infantry masses and a strong
artillery line. It is true that during the prevailing
severe cold the river was everywhere frozen over; but
only two high-roads led through the forest into the
valley from the direction by which the French army
was advancing, one to Montbéliard, the other to Héricourt.
The other accesses were narrow, hollow roads
rendered difficult of use by frost.</p>

<p>General von Tresckow had already armed the most
important points with siege guns, the castle of Montbéliard
with six, and the neighbouring height of La
Grange Dame with five heavy cannon. Seven were
placed on Mont Vaudois and near Héricourt; besides
these, twenty-one others commanded the valley of the
Allaine southward as far as Delle.</p>

<p>All the troops that could be spared from the investing
force were also withdrawn from before Belfort. Still
there remained the important consideration that the
available forces might not suffice to entirely cover the
whole of the Lisaine line. The right wing was the locally
weakest portion of the whole position, but here there was
the least to be apprehended, the enemy's main attack,
since the many needs of the numerous but inadequately
equipped French army made the nearest possible
vicinity of one of the railroads a necessity. The
Vesoul line by way of Lure was broken in many
places, and the Besançon line led towards the strong
left wing. The country north of Chagey might therefore
more weakly be held, and a reserve was formed of
the largest part of the Baden Division, which was distributed
in rear of the centre and left about Mandrevillars,
Brévilliers and Charmont.</p>

<p>The respite accorded by the enemy was turned to
account with the utmost zeal in the construction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
rifle-pits and of battery emplacements, the establishment
of telegraph and relay lines, the improvement of
roads and the replenishment of supplies and ammunition.</p>

<p><i>January 13th.</i>&mdash;On the morning of the 13th the
advanced posts of the 3rd Reserve Division were now
attacked at Arcey, Ste. Marie and Gonvillars. They
were instructed to withdraw before a superior force,
but to hold their own long enough to compel the deployment
of the hostile columns. The combat with
French artillery coming up at wide intervals was therefore
prolonged for a considerable time; then, after a three
hours' resistance, a new position was taken up behind
the Rupt brook, and the retirement on Tavey delayed
until four in the afternoon. The advanced guard of
General von der Goltz, after a whole brigade had deployed
against it, also took up a position at Chavanni
on a parallel front with that at Couthenans.</p>

<p>Before the Allaine front the French did not succeed
in driving General von Debschitz's advanced posts out
of Dasle and Croix.</p>

<p><i>January 14th.</i>&mdash;On the 14th General von Willisen
with fifty dismounted Dragoons drove back the enemy
advancing on Lure, and then retired with his detachment
on Ronchamp.</p>

<p>The French army did not yet on this day undertake
a serious attack. It stood with the XVth, XXIVth, and
XXth Corps, closely concentrated opposite the German
left and centre at a distance of scarcely four-and-a-half
miles. The German right was supposed by General
Bourbaki to rest upon Mont Vaudois. His plan was to
cross the Lisaine in force above this point of support,
and by thus turning the hostile flank to facilitate a
frontal attack. The XVIIIth Army Corps and the
Division Crémer were assigned to this service. A drawback
to this judicious arrangement was, that the two
above-mentioned bodies designed by the officer in
supreme command to open the fight on the 14th, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
have the longest distance to march to their task. On
this day the leading troops of the XVIIIth Army Corps
barely succeeded in reaching the vicinity of Lomont
through difficult hill and woodland region, and
Crémer's Brigade<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> had only then begun to advance
from Vesoul. A postponement to the 15th was thereupon
determined.</p>

<p>On the German side, a general attack by the greatly
superior enemy was hourly expected, and General von
Werder felt himself bound to send by telegraph to
Versailles a representation of the extreme seriousness
of his position. The rivers, being frozen over, were passable,
and the duty of covering Belfort deprived him of
freedom of movement and endangered the existence of
his corps. He earnestly prayed that the question
should be weighed, whether the investment of Belfort
should continue to be maintained.</p>

<p>In the supreme Head-quarter it was considered that
any further retirement of the XVth<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Army Corps
would have the immediate effect of raising the siege of
Belfort, and causing the loss of the considerable
material which had been provided therefor; that it
was impossible to foresee where such further retirement
would end; and that it could but delay the co-operation
of the army advancing by forced marches under General
von Manteuffel. At three o'clock on the afternoon of
15th January a positive order was despatched to General
von Werder to accept battle in front of Belfort. He
was, as was only fair, relieved of the moral responsibility
of the consequences of a possibly disastrous issue.
But before this order reached him, the General had
already come to the same resolution.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Battle on the Lisaine.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(January 15th to 17th.)</div>


<p><i>January 15th.</i>&mdash;On the morning of the 15th of
January, two Divisions of the French XVth Corps,
strengthened by artillery, advanced on Montbéliard;
a third followed in reserve. The East-Prussian Landwehr
battalions, which had pushed forward to the
Mont Chevis Farm and Ste. Suzanne, held their position
for a long time, advanced on their part to the attack,
and drove the heads of the enemy's columns back upon
the Rupt brook. But when the latter in the afternoon
deployed in greater force along the edge of the wood, the
Landwehr advanced posts were at two o'clock ordered
back to the left bank of the Lisaine. The town of
Montbéliard, entirely commanded by the surrounding
heights, was also voluntarily evacuated, only its fortified
castle being held. But east of Montbéliard General von
Glümer with the 1st Baden Brigade had taken up a position,
and had brought up four field-batteries alongside
the siege guns on the plateau of La Grange Dame.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the day the French, after a
continuous but ineffective bombardment from eight
batteries, took possession of the town, but did not make
any further advance.</p>

<p>Neither had they prospered in their attempt to cross
the Lisaine at Béthoncourt. An officer and sixty men,
who had sought cover within a walled graveyard from
the sharp fire of the defenders, were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Further to the north the French XXIVth Corps
continued to advance, but it was two o'clock before its
columns were able to deploy from the wood. Four
battalions did, indeed, succeed in taking possession of
the village of Bussurel on the western bank of the
Lisaine, but their further advance was frustrated by
the fire of the defenders in cover behind the railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
embankment, and by that of the Baden battalions and
batteries brought up from the main reserve.</p>

<p>Héricourt, on the great high road from Besançon and
only little more than four miles from Belfort, became a
point of special importance in the German fighting line.
Here in front of the Lisaine the right wing of the 4th
Reserve Division struck the enemy.</p>

<p>The little wooded knoll of Mougnot, which forms a
sort of bridge-head to the narrow gorge through which
the road passes, had been fortified by the pioneers with
abatis, battery emplacements and rifle-pits, the town
in its rear prepared for defence, and the base of the
heights on either of its sides faced with artillery. Four
East-Prussian Landwehr battalions were in touch on
the right with the Reserve Brigade, which held the
slope of Mont Vaudois as far as Luze.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock the French deployed their artillery
on the bare heights close to the line of approach in
the vicinity of Trémoins. Upon their infantry advancing
leftwards through Byans, the German detachment
which till then had been left in Tavey fell back on
Héricourt in reserve, and the enemy's first attack on
Mougnot was shattered by the resistance of its defenders,
and by the fire of sixty-one guns on the further bank
of the river. The attempt was not repeated that day,
and the French confined themselves to a heavy but
ineffective cannonade.</p>

<p>According to the instructions issued by General
Bourbaki, the XXth Corps was to await the result of
the great outflanking movement which was to be carried
out by General Billot with the XVIIIth Corps and
Crémer's Division. As, however, these had not yet
put in an appearance, the Army-Reserve had to be
brought up leftward to Coisevaux to protect General
Clinchant's flank.</p>

<p>The orders from the Army Head-quarter had not
reached the XVIIIth Corps until midnight. It had
moreover to accomplish a difficult march by deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
snowed-up woodland paths. This entailed crossings,
not only between the flank columns of its 1st and 3rd
Divisions, but even with the Division Crémer at
Lyoffans. This Division had only by dint of the
greatest exertion reached Lure during the night, and
could not get further on to Béverne until nine in the
morning. A fresh delay was occasioned by the order
to bring up in front of the infantry the artillery&mdash;even
the reserve artillery which was marching in the very
rear; and thus it happened that the XVIIIth Corps did
not succeed in deploying two of its Divisions opposite
Luze and Chagey till between 12 and 2 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The 1st Division occupied Couthenans with one
battalion, and brought up five batteries on the reverse
slope of the heights to the north of that place. But
the fire from the opposite bank prevented their further
progress, and in a short time several of the batteries
had but two guns left fit for action, although the Germans,
in view of the difficulty of replenishment, used
their ammunition as sparingly as possible. At three
o'clock there was a pause in the artillery fight, which
however was resumed energetically on the arrival of
reinforcements, when the artillery of the XXIVth
Corps coming from Byans took part in it. An
infantry attack on a large scale was not yet attempted.</p>

<p>There was scarcely more vigour in the advance of
the 3rd Division against Chagey, which was occupied
only by a Baden battalion; yet it was from here that
the outflanking movement of the German right wing by
turning Mont Vaudois was to be gone upon. The
wood reached to the first houses of the village, and the
only difficulty was the climb up the steep face of the
height. Two French battalions suddenly burst from the
gorge south of it, and drove in the Baden outposts;
the further attack was to have been supported from
Couthenans on the south, but the infantry advancing
from thence found itself forced to turn back by the fire
from the opposite bank. Only by a renewed effort did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the Zouaves succeed in entering Chagey, where a stubborn
fight raged in and around the houses. Meanwhile
two Baden battalions came up, who, at five o'clock,
drove the enemy out of the village back into the wood.
Fresh reinforcements hastened to the support of the
latter from the reserve near by, the short winter's day
was over, and here during the night the French
attempted nothing further. The 2nd Division of the
French Corps had only advanced as far as Béverne, the
cavalry had not moved from Lyoffans.</p>

<p>The Division Crémer, despite its late arrival at
Lure, had continued the march in the early morning.
After the above-mentioned crossings and resultant
delays the 1st Brigade advanced on Etobon, and there
at noon it engaged in a fight with a Baden detachment
under the command of General von Degenfeld.
When the 2nd Brigade also came up, the 1st moved
forward through the Bois de la Thure, with intent to
cross the Lisaine above Chagey. Parts of the roads
had first to be made practicable by the pioneers, involving
considerable delay. The 2nd Brigade then followed
in the dark, having left a detachment in
observation at Etobon. A fresh collision with some
Baden detachments determined General Crémer to
extinguish all the watch-fires. His troops remained
under arms throughout the hard winter night.</p>

<p>On the German side, all the troops not on guard
duty found shelter in the neighbouring villages, the
pioneers only being kept at work with their pickaxes.
The actions had cost both sides about 600 men, without
bringing about any decisive result; but every day was
a gain to the defenders.</p>

<p>General Von Werder, on the heights north of Héricourt,
had received constant reports regarding the
course of the fighting from the General Staff officers
sent out in various directions, by which he was able to
regulate the abstraction from the reserves of reinforcements
to the fighting line. The diminution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
ammunition was a cause of anxiety, since a consignment
announced from Baden had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>General Bourbaki informed his Government that he
had taken Montbéliard, it was true without the castle,
had occupied the villages on the west bank of the
Lisaine, and that he would attack on the 16th. He
had learned from General Billot that the German right
wing extended considerably beyond Mont Vaudois,
whence he inferred that important reinforcements had
reached the enemy, whose strength he estimated at
80,000 to 100,000 men. Nevertheless he anticipated
a fortunate issue for the outflanking operation by fetching
a yet wider compass to the left.</p>

<p><i>January 16th.</i>&mdash;At half-past six on the morning of
the 16th the Germans again stood to arms in the positions
of the previous day.</p>

<p>The French again began the attack with their right
wing. From the loopholed houses they fired on the
Landwehr company holding the castle of Montbéliard,
causing some loss among the latter as well as among
the gunners. The summons to surrender was disregarded,
and the fire of the fortress artillery was
used to such good purpose against two batteries which
showed themselves on the neighbouring height, that
these were obliged to retire, leaving behind them two
guns. Neither could they advance from a new position
they had taken up at the farm of Mont Chevis, and
where they had been reinforced by three batteries,
against the fire from La Grange Dame, although the
cannonade continued until dark. No attempt was
made from Montbéliard to pierce the German line.</p>

<p>Further to the left the reinforced 1st Division of the
French XVth Corps advanced on Béthoncourt. At
one o'clock the fire of its artillery from Mont Chevis
and Byans obliged a Baden battery to limber up, and
it was then directed on the village. Large bodies
had been massed in the neighbouring forest, from
out which at three o'clock they advanced. General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Glümer had meantime despatched reinforcements to the
threatened front. Two determined attempts pushed
close up to the village were frustrated by the destructive
artillery and rifle fire of the defenders. A third
attack made with a whole brigade at four o'clock, was
not permitted even to approach. The losses on the
French side were considerable, and the snowy field was
strewn with the fallen. Some unwounded prisoners
were also taken.</p>

<p>One Division of the XXIVth French Corps had
taken up a covered position in the woods behind Byans,
and as it had already occupied Bussurel on the previous
day, the German defensive position here in the rear
of the railway embankment appeared to be threatened
from the immediate vicinity. The General in command
therefore sent General Keller with two Baden Fusilier
battalions and one heavy battery from Brévilliers in
this direction. The latter joined the two batteries
which had been engaged on the slope of the hill since
morning. The fire of five of the enemy's batteries was
soon silenced by the unerring projectiles from the
German guns. At noon the French artillery retired
from Byans, leaving there also two guns, which could
only be brought away later. The infantry, one Division
strong, had only threatened to pierce the line, without
proceeding to carry out the attempt.</p>

<p>The XXth Corps brought up two Divisions against
the line Héricourt&mdash;Luze. A thick fog covered the
valley, and the early cannonade was at first scarcely
answered by the Germans. To obtain some insight
into the intentions of the enemy, two companies
advanced to the height west of St. Valbert, and surprised
the enemy moving up from Byans with so rapid a fire
that he turned back. But soon after, at half-past nine,
several battalions burst out from Tavey against the
Mougnot. Two attacks were frustrated by the steady
resistance of the Landwehr battalions, and a third
attempt directed against the southern exit from Héricourt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
did not succeed. About four o'clock fresh masses
of infantry again gathered against the Mougnot, but
coming under fire from Mont Salamou, they shrank
from further attacks, and confined themselves till
evening to an ineffective cannonade.</p>

<p>At Chagey two Divisions of the XVIIIth Corps
found themselves face to face with the Germans. They
did not attempt anything.</p>

<p>The little spirit with which on January 16th the
action along the whole front from Montbéliard to
Chagey was conducted, pointed to the conclusion that
the French were everywhere awaiting the issue of the
scheme of out-flanking the German right wing.</p>

<p>This task now devolved on General Crémer. The
2nd Division of the XVIIIth Corps joined him at
Etobon.</p>

<p>Two Divisions advanced thence on Chenebier, where
General von Degenfeld stood with two battalions, two
batteries, and one squadron. There could be no doubt
as to the result. At eleven o'clock the Division Penhoat
of the XVIIIth Corps advanced to encompass the
place on the west and north, and the Division Crémer,
for the purpose of barring the defenders' line of retreat
on Belfort, advanced on the south, where the wood of
La Thure covered his approach. The batteries of both
Divisions were brought up in the afternoon on its
northern edge, where they opened fire. After they
had been in action for two hours, the infantry masses
advanced from three sides. Under General Crémer's
personal leading the Baden Fusiliers were driven from
the southern to the northern part of the village, and
as his encompassment therein through the wood of
Montedin was practicable, General von Degenfeld,
after an obstinate resistance, at three o'clock was
obliged to take up his retreat in a northerly direction
through Frahier. Thence he again turned south-east
and took up a position in front of Chalonvillars,
about the high-lying windmill of Rougeot, where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
at six o'clock, he was joined by Colonel Bayer with
reinforcements. The French did not pursue; the Division
Crémer, which had lost 1000 men, retired, on the
contrary, into the wood of La Thure, while Penhoat's
Division confined itself to the occupation of Chenebier.</p>

<p>Thus the German line of defence was nowhere
broken on this day; still, its extreme right wing had
been driven back to within little more than three miles
of Belfort.</p>

<p>The fortress celebrated the success of the French
arms by a victory-salute, but made no serious sortie on
the investing forces, weakened as they were by the
despatch of reinforcements; and the latter, on their side,
quietly continued the construction of batteries.</p>

<p>General von Werder, anxious above all things to
re-establish the fighting position on his right wing,
could however only gather in as a general reserve
four battalions, four squadrons, and two batteries,
bringing up these from the least exposed places and
even from Belfort, to Brévilliers and Mandrevillars.
At eight o'clock in the evening General Keller was
ordered to retake Chenebier. On this errand he left
Mandrevillars with two Baden battalions, reached
Moulin Rougeot at midnight, and found Frahier already
occupied by Colonel Bayer.</p>

<p><i>January 17th.</i>&mdash;On this morning eight battalions, two
squadrons, and four batteries were assembled in Frahier.
Three of the battalions advanced on the northern, three
on the southern part of Chenebier; the others remained
in reserve at the windmill, where also three 15 cm.
cannon were to be stationed.</p>

<p>At half-past four a.m. the first column, advancing in
dead silence, surprised an outpost of the enemy's at
Echevanne, but it was unavoidable that its rifle fire
should make the French in Chenebier aware of the
danger by which they were menaced. In the wood
north of the village, the Germans met with serious
resistance; and the danger that in the darkness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
the dense undergrowth the troops might fall on each
other obliged their withdrawal to the outer edge of the
wood.</p>

<p>The other column, advancing in the valley of the
Lisaine, had quickened its pace from Moulin Colin
as soon as the first shots were heard. The 2nd
battalion of the 4th Baden Regiment rushed with
cheers into the southern part of Chenebier, where a
great confusion ensued. But daybreak showed that
the heights on the west of the village were strongly
occupied, and that columns of all arms were approaching
from Etobon. At 8.30 Colonel Payen had to resolve
on retirement from the half-conquered village, carrying
with him 400 prisoners, and on taking up a position
at the Bois de Féry, to cover the road to Belfort
through Chalonvillars.</p>

<p>At the same time the right column, strengthened by
a battalion from the reserve, renewed the attack on the
wood, and after a struggle which lasted for two hours
with heavy losses on both sides, at last took possession of
it. But the attempt to penetrate into the barricaded
and strongly-defended village was vain. A destructive
fire met every attack; a single round of mitrailleuse
fire, for instance, struck down twenty-one men of the
Baden assailants. At three o'clock in the afternoon
General Keller therefore assembled his troops at
Frahier, where they were supported by four batteries.</p>

<p>With such inferior strength, and after failing in this
attempt, it was useless to think of driving back the
enemy beyond Chenebier; the only course to pursue was
to hinder his further advance on Belfort. And this
object was fully accomplished; the French did not
pursue. Instead of out-flanking the German right,
they seemed chiefly concerned for their own left.
They defended Chenebier stoutly, but gave up all
further offensive movements.</p>

<p>While awaiting the expected success of the out-flanking
movement, General Bourbaki's intention
seems to have been merely to occupy the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
along his front and to hold him fast where he stood.
Even during the night the Germans were alarmed at
Béthoncourt and before Héricourt, while they, on
their part, disturbed the French at Bussurel and in
the Bois de La Thure. The infantry fire went on for
hours, and numerous detachments had to spend the
bitter winter's night under arms. In the morning two
Divisions of the XVIIIth French Corps advanced on
Chagey and Luze, but their batteries, although supported
by the artillery of the Army Reserve, they
could not advance against those of the Germans, and
repeated attacks on those villages were unsuccessful.
After one o'clock a cannonade only was maintained
here. In front of Héricourt also there was an exchange
of shell fire, and Bussurel, held by the French, was
set on fire.</p>

<p>To drive the French out of Montbéliard, the town
was fired on from La Grange Dame and from the
Château, but ceased when the inhabitants begged forbearance
on the assurance that the place was evacuated,
which subsequently proved not quite true. Ten
battalions of the French XVth Corps advanced from
the woods in the forenoon, and tried to push on past
Montbéliard, but suffered severely from the flanking
fire of the heavy guns at La Grange Dame, and only
a handful got into the valley of the Lisaine. The
western exits from Montbéliard, and the heights immediately
behind it, remained in French possession, but
the offensive movements ceased at about two in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>Further to the south, General von Debschitz's posts
in front of Allaine had easily repulsed the French
assailants.</p>

<p>On the German side there was now the conviction
that no further attack would be attempted.</p>

<p>The condition of the French troops, not yet inured to
war, was, in fact, very critical. They had been obliged
to bivouac in the bitterly cold nights, sometimes under
arms, and for the most part without food. Their losses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
were not inconsiderable, and the superior officers whom
the commanding General assembled at three in the afternoon,
in the neighbourhood of Chagey, expressed their
objections to a yet more extensive outflanking attempt
to the left, since supplies would be utterly impossible,
and the risk would be entailed of the Germans seizing
the line of the communications of the army through
Montbéliard. Then came the news that the heads of
General von Manteuffel's Corps had already reached
Fontaine-Française, and were also approaching Gray.</p>

<p>In these circumstances General Bourbaki considered
he must resolve on a retreat. He telegraphed
to the Government that by the advice of his generals,
and to his deep regret, he had been compelled to take
up a position further in the rear, and only hoped that
the enemy might follow him. Hence this experienced
general could have felt no doubt that his army, its
attack on the Lisaine, once gone to wreck, could
only escape from a very critical position by an immediate
retreat.</p>

<p><i>January 18th.</i>&mdash;This morning the Germans were
under arms in their positions of the previous day, the
French still in full force before the whole front. It
was significant that they were busy in the construction
of earthworks. They had evacuated Montbéliard the
evening before in disorderly retreat, and now held
the country west of the place in strength and
entrenched.</p>

<p>During this day nothing occurred but a cannonade
and small skirmishes. General Keller having been
reinforced came up on the right, and as the enemy
retired to Etobon he was able to re-occupy Chenebier
in the afternoon. Further north, Colonel von Willisen
again marched on Ronchamp. In the centre
Coutenans was taken possession of, and the enemy
driven out of Byans by artillery fire; but on the
other hand the Germans could not yet penetrate the
belt of forest. On the southern bank of the Allaine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
General von Debschitz's detachments drove the enemy
back beyond the line Exincourt-Croix.</p>

<p>In the three days' fighting on the Lisaine the Germans
lost 1200, the French from 4000 to 5000 men.</p>

<p>In spite of much necessary detaching, and of the
threatening proximity of the enemy, the siege-works
against Belfort were uninterruptedly carried on, and as
soon as the complement of the investing forces was
again made up, General von Werder followed the
retiring French to Etobon, Saulnot and Arcey.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">The Artillery Attack on Paris.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(January, 1871.)</div>


<p>In the place of the IInd Corps, which had been
assigned to the German Army of the South, there had
come up into the Paris front the Ist Bavarian Corps,
of which Gambetta had said, "The Bavarians no longer
exist." It had made so good use of its time of rest in
quarters south of Longjumeau that by the beginning of
the New Year it was already restored to a strength of
17,500 men, with 108 guns. It was positioned on both
banks of the Seine between the VIth Prussian Corps
and the Würtemberg Division. The Würtembergers
reached from Ormesson to the Marne, from which river
the Saxons extended rightward to the Sausset brook,
so as to narrow the front of the Guard Corps now that
the Morée was frozen over and afforded no cover.</p>

<p>The duty of watching so vast a place of arms as
Paris had made great demands on the endurance of the
troops.</p>

<p>The French had gradually so extended their entrenchments
outwards from Villejuif and Bruyères,
that they threatened to outflank the IInd Bavarian
Corps. To thwart such a flank attack the VIth Corps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
was obliged to keep a strong force constantly in
readiness at L'Hay.</p>

<p>It need not be said that the supporting troops on
the south front could nowhere be safe from the fire
of the heavy fortress guns, nor the foreposts from that
of the Chassepôts. The latter consequently often could
not be relieved for several days, and the relief was
usually effected at night. The less the success of the
French arms in the open field, the more lavish were they
in the expenditure of ammunition from their works.
Mont Valérien hurled its giant shells to a distance
of from four to five miles, but this incessant cannonade,
to the din of which the ear was soon accustomed, did
little damage.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Artillery Attack on the Southern Front.</span>&mdash;Till
Mont Avron was taken, the Germans had only
been able to oppose field guns to French fortress
artillery. But early in January their preparations were
at last so far forward that seventeen batteries, long
since completed, could be armed with heavy guns against
the south front of Paris. A battery stood apart on
the left flank in the park of St. Cloud to the north of
Sèvres; four were close together on the steep slope
of the height west of the Château Meudon; five on the
edge of the plateau of Moulin de la Tour, where the
mill, serving to guide the aim of the enemy, had
been blown up. Four more batteries occupied a
lower position between Fontenay and Bagneux. Two,
between Chevilly and La Rue, served as protection
against a flank movement from Villejuif, with the field
artillery of the IInd Bavarian and VIth Corps. Dressing-stations
were prepared, and intermediate depôts
were supplied with reserve ammunition from the great
magazines at Villacoublay.</p>

<p>Under Generals von Kameke<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and Prince Hohenlohe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Colonels von Rieff and von Ramm conducted the artillery
attack, General Schulz commanded the engineer
attack. The men served twenty-four hours in the
batteries, and then had two days' rest. The officers
had but one day's rest.</p>

<p>The heavy guns were brought up on January 3rd,
by day, into the batteries which lay covered, without
any interference; into all the others during the night,
after the enemy's outposts had been driven in. Thus
on the morning of the 4th 98 guns were ready to open
fire: of these 28 were directed on Issy, 28 on Vanves,
and 18 on Montrouge, 10 against the emplacements
between the first two forts. But a thick fog hid every
object, and it was not till January 5th at 8.30 in
the morning, that the signal shot was given for opening
fire.</p>

<p><i>January 5th.</i>&mdash;The enemy promptly replied. There
were in Fort Valérien 106 guns, in Issy 90, in Vanves
84, and in Montrouge 52; there were about 70 in the
sectors of the enceinte concerned and at Villejuif,
16-cm. guns for the most part; so the attack at first
was heavily taxed. But when at about noon all its
batteries came into action, the situation gradually
improved and the greater accuracy of the German fire
told. Fort Issy had almost entirely ceased firing by two
o'clock, nine guns were dismounted in Vanves, and its
garrison had lost thirty men; only Montrouge still
replied with vigour. The fire was now taken up by the
guns of the enceinte, but the forts never again gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the upper hand of the attack. Some gunboats appearing
about Point du Jour very soon had to retire. The
field artillery of the IInd Bavarian and VIth Corps
also co-operated so energetically that no attack was
attempted from the works at Villejuif, nor was a single
shot fired on the batteries at Bagneux. A number of
wall-pieces and long-range Chassepôts taken from the
enemy did such good service that the French abandoned
more and more of their rayon. The German outposts
took possession of the trenches of Clamart, and
in the course of the night reversed them against the
defence.</p>

<p>Only a couple of 15-cm. shells were thrown into the
city itself as a serious warning; the first thing to be done
was to batter down the outworks, and for some few
days the firing was exclusively directed on these. A
stubborn return fire came from Montrouge and from a
mortar-battery in a very advantageous position behind
the high railway embankment to the east of Issy; and
especially from the south front of the enceinte, nearly
four and a half miles long in a straight line. Foggy
weather on some days necessitated the suspension or
entire cessation of firing. But meanwhile the foreposts
had advanced to within 815 and 490 yards of Forts
Issy and Vanves respectively. New batteries were
constructed further forward, and armed with thirty-six
guns from those evacuated in rear.</p>

<p><i>January 10th.</i>&mdash;The French garrison meanwhile
was again displaying great activity. On January 10th
it succeeded in the dark hours in surprising the weakly-held
post of Clamart. Three battalions were now
posted in the place, and a shelter-trench some 1300
yards long was dug connecting Clamart with Châtillon.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>
<p><i>January 13th.</i>&mdash;The IInd Army of Paris was still
outside the city on the east and north fronts from
Nogent to Aubervillers. After some small alarms, on
the evening of the 13th strong bodies advanced from
Courneuve and Drancy against Le Bourget under cover
of a heavy fire from the forts. But the troops in
occupation there were on the alert, and being
soon reinforced by several companies, repulsed the
attempts of the French to storm it, repeated as they
were until two o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p><i>January 14th.</i>&mdash;On this day the French made a
renewed sortie on Clamart with 500 marine infantry
and several battalions of National Guards. These last
assembled at the adjacent railway-station with a great
deal of noise, and their approach was reported about
midnight. The fight lasted a full hour, and ended
with the retreat, or rather flight, of the assailants.
Patrols followed them close up to the trenches of
Issy.</p>

<p>The ranges were so great that hitherto the fire from
the enceinte was not yet subdued. Battery No. 1, lying
isolated in the Park of St. Cloud, suffered most, being
fired upon from two bastions of the enceinte, from Point
du Jour, and from Mont Valérien. The steep cliff
behind the battery facilitated the aim of the enemy.
Its parapet was repeatedly shattered, and it was only
the most zealous devotion which enabled the struggle
to be continued at this point. The enemy also concentrated
a heavy fire on batteries Nos. 19 and 21,
pushed forward into a position specially threatening
to Fort Vanves. The long-range fire from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
enceinte dropped from a high angle close behind the
parapet, breaking through the platforms, and inflicting
serious injuries on a great many gunners. The powder-magazines
blew up in two of the batteries, and both
the battery commanders and several other superior
officers were wounded.</p>

<p>On the east front of Paris, the fifty-eight German
guns remaining there after the reduction of Mont
Avron were opposed by 151 of the enemy. The
former nevertheless soon proved their superiority; the
forts only occasionally came into action; the
French withdrew their outposts up to the works, and
altogether vacated the peninsula of St. Maur. By
degrees the heavy siege-guns could be removed from
their previous positions to the Morée brook.</p>

<p>The forts on the south front had meanwhile suffered
severely. The ruin in Issy was visible to the naked
eye; fires broke out there repeatedly, and the powder-magazine
had to be cleared out at great risk in the
night of January 16th. Fort Vanves had lost seventy
men; it opened fire usually every morning, but soon
became silent. Montrouge, on the contrary, on some
days still fired over 500 rounds from eighteen guns.
But here, too, the casemates no longer afforded
any shelter, and one of the bastions lay a heap of
ruins.</p>

<p>In spite of the steady fire from the enceinte, a
part of Paris itself was disturbed by the 15-cm. shells.
An elevation of 30 degrees, obtained by a special contrivance,
sent the projectiles into the heart of the city.
From 300 to 400 shells were fired daily.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of "public opinion" the Government,
after repeated deliberations, decided once more
on a new enterprise in force, to be directed this time
against the German batteries about Châtillon. The collective
superior commanders agreed, indeed, that sorties
could promise no success without the co-operation of
a relieving army from the outside; but, on the 8th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Gambetta had announced the "victory" of the Army
of the North at Bapaume, and further had promised
that both the Armies of the Loire should advance.
Hereupon General Trochu advised that at least the moment
should be awaited when the investing army before
Paris should be weakened by having to detach anew part
of its strength; but he was opposed by the other members
of the Government, especially by Monsieur Jules
Favre. That gentleman declared that the Maires of
Paris were indignant at the bombardment, that the
representatives of the city must be allowed some insight
into the military situation, and, above all, that
negotiations ought long since to have been entered into.</p>

<p>Finally, on January 15th, it was determined that the
German lines should be broken through at Montretout,
Garches, and Buzanval.</p>

<p>While confusion and dissensions thus prevailed in
Paris, the unity of the German nation, under the
Emperor William, was solemnly proclaimed at Versailles.</p>

that the French, having possessed themselves by surprise of
the weak German post of Clamart, placed in it a garrison of
three battalions. The facts were, that the French battalion was
scarcely in possession of Clamart when it abandoned village and
redoubt; whereupon, to guard against any future attempt on the
place on the part of the French, the Germans occupied the village
with three battalions and the redoubt with two companies;
and further to ensure the security of the position, since it was
one of some importance, connected it with Châtillon in the manner
described.</p></div>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Battle of Mont Valérien.</span></h2>

<div class="center">(January 19th.)</div>


<p>The sortie was planned to take place on January
19th. On that day, as we have seen, General Faidherbe
advanced as far as St. Quentin on the way to Paris,
and the army which was to make the sortie stood on
the eastern and northern fronts of the capital. The
attempt to break through was, however, made in the
opposite direction. But in fact, the peninsula of
Gennevilliers was now the only ground on which large
masses of troops could still be deployed without being
exposed for hours while they were being assembled, to
the fire of the German artillery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days previously the mobilized National Guards
had already relieved the three Divisions of the sortie-Army
from the positions they had held; and those
Divisions, collectively 90,000 strong, were to move to
the attack in three columns simultaneously. General
Vinoy on the left, supported by the fire from the
enceinte, was to carry the height of Montretout;
General Bellemare in the centre was to push forward
through Garches; General Ducrot on the right by way
of the Château of Buzanval.</p>

<p>The attack was set to begin at six in the morning, but
blocks occurred at the bridges of Asnières and Neuilly,
as no specific orders had been issued for regulating
the crossing. When at seven o'clock the signal to advance
was made from Mont Valérien, only the advance
of General Vinoy's force was ready, the other
columns had not yet deployed, and the last detachments
tailed back as far as Courbevoix. Before they
had reached their rendezvous-points the left wing was
already marching on St. Cloud with fifteen battalions.</p>

<p>These at first met only isolated posts and patrols,
eighty-nine men in all, who rushed into the open gorge
of the redoubt of Montretout, and there made a stand
for some time; they then fought their way out with
great bravery, but some of them were taken prisoners.
There, and in the northern part of St. Cloud, the
French promptly prepared for defence.</p>

<p>The centre column under General Bellemare also
took possession without difficulty of the height of
Maison du Curé.</p>

<p>Not till now, at nearly nine o'clock, did the first supports
of the German forepost line appear on the scene.
Till within a short time the observatories had been
able to report nothing but "thick fog;" but reports
from the right and left wings announced that a serious
attack was threatened on the whole front from St.
Cloud to Bougival. The Vth Corps was now alarmed,
and General von Kirchbach betook himself to the 9th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Division. On the German right, in the park of St.
Cloud, stood the 17th Brigade; on the left, behind the
Porte de Longboyau, the 20th; the other troops of the
Corps marched from their quarters in Versailles and
the villages to its north, to Jardy and Beauregard.
The Crown Prince ordered six battalions of the Guard
Landwehr and a Bavarian Brigade to Versailles, and
himself rode to the Hospice of Brezin; the King went
to Marly.</p>

<p>The French meanwhile had seized the foremost
houses of Garches, and made their eastward way here
and there through the breaches in the wall into the
park of the Château of Buzanval. The 5th Jäger Battalion,
supported by single companies of the 58th and
59th Regiments, hurried forward and drove the enemy
back out of Garches, occupied the cemetery on its north,
and still reached the advanced post of La Bergerie just
at the right time. The other bodies under General von
Bothmer (commanding 17th Brigade, 9th Division, Vth
Corps), by order from the commanding General, maintained
a stationary fight on the skirts of the park of St.
Cloud, to gain time. About half-past nine they
repulsed an attack by Bellemare's column, arrested
the advance of the enemy along the Rue Impériale of
St. Cloud, and themselves took the offensive from the
Grille d'Orleans and the Porte Jaune. Five French
battalions unsuccessfully assaulted La Bergerie. A
section of Engineers tried with great devotion to
demolish the wall surrounding the court, but the
frozen dynamite did not explode, and the Jägers held
the position steadfastly throughout the day.</p>

<p>The attacks of the French had hitherto been undertaken
without assistance from their artillery. The
batteries of General Vinoy's advance had been seriously
delayed by crossing with the centre column, and were
now detained at Briqueterie to meet the contingency
of a repulse. General Bellemare's batteries tried to
get up the slope of the height of Garches, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
exhaustion of the teams made it necessary to take up
a position at Fouilleuse. Meanwhile the batteries of
the German 9th Division came up by degrees, and
by noon thirty-six guns had opened fire. In St. Cloud
a hot street-fight was going on.</p>

<p>Only General Ducrot on the French right wing had
opened the battle with his strong force of artillery,
which came into position on both sides of Rueil. The
tirailleurs then advanced and made their way through
the park of Buzanval to its western boundary-wall, but
were driven back by the 50th Fusilier Regiment which
had hastened forward.</p>

<p>At half-past ten the chief attack ensued at this
point, supported by part of the central column. It
found only an under-officer's post at Malmaison, but at
the eastern exit from Bougival near La Jouchère and
Porte de Longboyau, it encountered the already reinforced
line of posts of the 20th Infantry Brigade.
General von Schmidt (commanding 10th Infantry
Division) still held back at Beauregard the reserve of
the 10th Division. A murderous fire from the well-covered
German infantry broke the onset of the French,
and converted it by mid-day into a stationary fire fight,
in which the German artillery also took part with great
effect. Two batteries of the 10th Division at St.
Michel were reinforced by two Guard batteries brought
up from St. Germain to Louvenciennes; a third came
into action near Chatou and forced an armour-plated
train halted at the railway station north of Rueil to
retire rapidly to Nanterre. Four batteries of the IVth
Corps finally opened fire from Carrières, heedless of the
fire of Valérien, and shelled the dense masses of hostile
infantry halted in rear of Rueil.</p>

<p>At two o'clock the French decided on renewing the
attack. When two of their batteries had shelled Porte
de Longboyau a brigade marched on that point, and a
second on the western wall of the park of the Château
Buzanval; a third followed in support. Not less bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
than unsuccessful was the attempt of a section of
Engineers, one officer and ten men, to blow up part of
the wall; they all fell together. The attacking
columns had advanced to within 200 paces, when
thirteen German companies at the moment met them,
broke and stopped their rush by pouring fire into them
at short range, and presently routed the hostile columns
in disorder, in spite of the devoted exertions of the
officers.</p>

<p>The French, however, still found a strong protection
in the park-wall, which had been prepared for defence
with great skill and with the utmost rapidity; and
the advance of several companies from Brezin and La
Bergerie on this wall was repulsed with heavy loss.</p>

<p>But the strength of the French attack was already
broken. So early as three o'clock a movement of
retreat was observable in their left wing, and as dusk
fell the French centre began to withdraw from the
heights of Maison du Curé. When Colonel von Köthen
pursued, with a small force, several battalions indeed
fronted, and even threatened a sharp counter-attack;
but timely support arrived from La Bergerie, Garches,
and Porte Jaune, and, backed by the fire of the batteries,
the pursuit was followed up. The King's Grenadiers
drove back the enemy to the vicinity of
Fouilleuse.</p>

<p>The Germans, however, had not yet succeeded in
repossessing themselves of the Montretout redoubt.
The chief hindrance arose from their having been
unable to advance through the town of St. Cloud. As,
however, the possession of this position was indispensable
for the protection of the right wing, General von
Kirchbach gave orders that it was to be retaken either
that evening or early next morning.</p>

<p>General von Sandrart (commanding 9th Infantry
Division) decided on immediate action, and at eight
that evening five battalions went forward on this duty.
Only a few French were found in the redoubt and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
taken prisoners; but in the town the struggle was
severe. Finally the Germans had to restrict themselves
to blockading the houses held temporarily by the
enemy. The French also clung to the outer park-wall
of Buzanval throughout the night. The Guard
Landwehr and the Bavarian Brigade were therefore
assigned quarters in Versailles, to form a strong reserve
at hand in case of need on the following day. The
remainder of the troops withdrew into their former
quarters.</p>

<p>At half-past five General Trochu had issued the order
for a retreat. He perceived that the prolongation of
the struggle could afford no success, especially as the
National Guards were becoming insubordinate. The
brave defenders of St. Cloud were forgotten in these
directions. They did not surrender till the day after,
when artillery was brought against the houses they
occupied. And the park-wall was not relinquished
till the following morning.</p>

<p>The French attack of January 19th was wrecked even
before it had reached the main position of the defenders.
The reserves in readiness on the German side had not
needed to be brought into action. The Vth Corps
alone had driven back an enemy of four times its
own strength. It lost 40 officers and 570 men; the
loss of the French in killed and wounded was 145
officers and 3423 men, besides 44 officers and 458 men
taken prisoners.</p>

<p>When the fog lifted at about eleven o'clock on the
morning of the 20th, their long columns were seen
retreating on Paris across the peninsula of Gennevilliers.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Prosecution of the Artillery Attack on Paris
up to the Armistice.</span></h2>


<p>After the repulse of this last struggle for release on
the part of the garrison, the extension of the artillery
attack to the north front of the defensive position was
now determined on. The siege guns no longer needed
against the minor French fortresses and on the Marne
had been parked for this object at Villiers le Bel. The
Army of the Meuse had prepared abundant material for
the construction of batteries, and had collected a waggon
park of above 600 vehicles. Twelve batteries had already
been built in the lines between Le Bourget and the Lake
of Enghien, the arming of which followed, for the most
part, under cover of night. On January 21st eighty-one
heavy guns were ready for action, and Colonel
Bartsch opened fire at nine that morning on Forts La
Briche, Double Couronne, and de l'Est.</p>

<p>The forts, which opposed the attack with 143 heavy
guns, replied vigorously, and on the following day
the thick weather prevented the German batteries from
resuming their fire till the afternoon. But the ground
in front was abandoned by the French, and the outposts
of the Guards and IVth Corps took possession of Villetaneuse
and Temps Perdu. During the nights the fire
was directed on St. Denis, with every endeavour to spare
the Cathedral, and many conflagrations occurred. By
the 23rd the vigorous prosecution of the cannonade had
materially subdued the fire of the defence. La Briche
was wholly silenced, and the other forts only fired
occasional salvos. During the night of the 25th four
batteries were advanced to within 1300 and 950 yards
respectively of the enemy's main works. The engineer
attack also could now be undertaken, and a series of
new batteries was constructed, which, however, were
never used.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of this bombardment of only six days'
duration was decisive. The forts had suffered extraordinarily.
In contrast to those of the south front
they were destitute of the powerful backing of the
enceinte, and they lacked, too, bomb-proof shelter.
The provisional bomb-proofs were pierced by shells,
the powder-magazines were in the greatest danger,
and the garrisons had nowhere any more cover. The
inhabitants of St. Denis fled to Paris in crowds, and
the impaired immunity from storm of the sorely
battered works was an insuperable obstacle to a longer
maintenance of the defence. This northern attack
cost the Germans one officer and 25 men; the French
stated their loss at 180.</p>

<p>The fire of the forts on the east front was kept
under, and the Würtemberg Field Artillery sufficed to
prevent the enemy from renewing his foothold on the
peninsula of St. Maur.</p>

<p>The south front meanwhile suffered more and more
from the steady bombardment. The enceinte and the
sunken mortar batteries behind the ceinture railway
were still active, but in the forts the barracks were
reduced to ruins, partly battered in and partly burnt
down, and the garrisons had to take shelter in the emptied
powder-magazines. The covered ways could no longer
be traversed safely, the parapets afforded no protection.
In Vanves the embrasures were filled up with
sandbags; in the southern curtain of Issy five blocks
of casemates had been pierced by shells penetrating
the shielding walls. Even the detached gorge-walls of
Vanves and Montrouge were destroyed, forty guns
were dismounted, and seventy gun carriages wrecked.</p>

<p>The whole condition of France, political and military,
and above all the situation in Paris, was such as to
cause the Government the gravest anxiety.</p>

<p>Since the return of Monsieur Thiers from his diplomatic
tour, it was certain that no mediatory interposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
by any foreign power could be expected. The
distress of the capital had become more and more
severe. Scarcity and high prices had long borne
heavily on its population; provisions were exhausted,
and even the stores of the garrison had been seriously
encroached on. Fuel was lacking in the lasting
cold, and petroleum was an inefficient substitute for
gas. When the long-deferred bombardment of the
south side of Paris was had recourse to, the people
took refuge in the cellars or fled to the remoter quarters
of the city; and when it was also begun on the
northern side the inhabitants of St. Denis crowded into
the capital.</p>

<p>The great sortie of the 19th had proved a total
failure, and no relief was to be hoped for from outside
since Gambetta had sent news of the disaster at Le
Mans. The Paris Army, of whose inactivity he complained,
was reduced to a third of its original strength
by cold, sickness, and desertion, and the heart taken
out of it by repeated miscarriages. Its horses had to
be slaughtered to provide meat for the inhabitants, and
General Trochu declared any further offensive movements
to be quite hopeless; the means even of passive
resistance were exhausted.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Government had been able to keep the
populace in good humour by highly-coloured reports,
but now the disastrous state of affairs could no longer
be concealed. All its projects were now denounced.</p>

<p>There was a large class of people in Paris who were
but little affected by the general distress. Numbers of
civilians had been armed for the defence of their
country and were fed and well paid by the authorities,
without having too much to do in return. They were
joined by all the dubious social elements, which found
their reckoning in the disorganized situation. These
had been quite satisfied with the condition which the
4th of September had created, and a little later they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
displayed themselves in the hideous form of the Commune.
Already some popular gatherings had been
dispersed only by force of arms, and even a part of the
National Guard were not free from mutinous tendencies.
The revolutionary clubs, too, supported by the press,
clamoured for further enterprises, even a sortie <i>en
masse</i> of all the inhabitants of Paris. Thus the feeble
Government, dependent as it was on popular favour
alone, was under pressure from the impossible demands
of an ignorant mob on the one hand, and, on the
other, the inexorable force of actual facts.</p>

<p>There was absolutely no expedient possible but the
capitulation of the capital; every delay intensified the
necessity, and enforced the acceptance of harder terms.
Unless all the railways were at once thrown open for
the transport of supplies from a very wide area, the
horrors of famine would inevitably fall on a population
of more than two million souls; and later it might not
be practicable to cope with the emergency. Yet no
one dared utter the fatal word "capitulation," no one
would undertake the responsibility for the inevitable.</p>

<p>A great council of war was held on the 21st. In it
all the elder Generals pronounced any further offensive
measures to be quite impossible. It was proposed that
a council of the younger officers should also be held,
but no decision was arrived at. As, however, some one
must be made answerable for every misfortune, General
Trochu, originally the most popular member of the
Government, was dismissed from his position as
Governor, and the chief military command was entrusted
to General Vinoy. General Ducrot resigned
his command.</p>

<p>All this did nothing to improve the situation, so on
the 23rd, Monsieur Jules Favre made his appearance at
Versailles to negotiate in the first instance for an
armistice.</p>

<p>On the German side there was readiness to meet this
request; but of course some guarantee had to be forthcoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
that the capital, after having been reprovisioned,
would not renew its resistance. The surrender of the
forts, inclusive of Mont Valérien and the town of St.
Denis, as well as the disarmament of the enceinte was
demanded and acceded to.</p>

<p>Hostilities were to be suspended on the evening of
the 26th, so far as Paris was concerned, and all supplies
to be freely given. A general armistice of twenty-one
days was then to come in force on the 31st of January,
exclusive, however, of the departments of Doubs, Jura,
and Côte d'Or, and the fortress of Belfort, where for the
time operations were still being carried on, in which
both sides were hopeful of success.</p>

<p>This armistice gave the Government of National
Defence the time necessary for assembling a freely-elected
National Assembly at Bordeaux, which should
decide whether the war should be continued, or on what
conditions peace should be concluded. The election
of the deputies was unimpeded and uninfluenced even
in the parts of the country occupied by the Germans.</p>

<p>The regular forces of the Paris garrison, troops of
the line, marines, and Gardes-Mobiles, had to lay down
their arms at once; only 12,000 men and the National
Guard were allowed to retain them for the preservation
of order inside the city. The troops of the garrison
were interned there during the armistice; on its expiry
they were to be regarded as prisoners. As to their
subsequent transfer to Germany, where every available
place was already overflowing with prisoners, the question
was postponed in expectation of a probable peace.</p>

<p>The forts were occupied on the 29th without opposition.</p>

<p>There were taken over from the Field Army of Paris
602 guns, 1,770,000 stand of arms, and above 1000
ammunition waggons; from the fortress 1362 heavy
guns, 1680 gun-carriages, 860 limbers, 3,500,000 cartridges,
4000 hundred-weight of powder, 200,000 shells,
and 100,000 bombs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>The blockade of Paris, which had lasted 132 days,
was over, and the greater part of the German forces
which had so long stood fast under its walls, was
released to end the war in the open field.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">The Operations of the Army of the South under
General von Manteuffel.</span></h2>


<p>The two Army Corps under General von Manteuffel
consisted altogether of fifty-six battalions, twenty
squadrons, and 168 guns. When it arrived at
Châtillon sur Seine on January 12th, the IInd Corps
was on the right, and the VIIth on the left on an
extension from Noyers Montigny of about forty-five
miles. One brigade, under General von Dannenberg,
which had already several times been in contact with
portions of the French Army of the Vosges, was pushed
forward to Vilaines and was charged with the duty of
covering the right flank.</p>

<p>Several good roads led from the quarters specified in
the direction of Dijon; to Vesoul, on the contrary,
there were only bad tracks deep in snow over the
southern slope of the wild plateau of Langres. The
Commander-in-Chief, nevertheless, chose this direction,
that he might as soon as possible afford General von
Werder at least indirect assistance by approaching in
the rear of the enemy threatening his brother-officer.</p>

<p>The march had to pass midway between the towns
of Dijon and Langres, both points strongly occupied by
the French. Wooded heights and deep ravines separated
the columns and precluded mutual support; each
body had to provide for its individual safety in every
direction. The troops had previously undergone severe
fatigues, and badly as they needed rest not one halt-day
could be granted, nor could the evil plight of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
boots and the horses' shoes be in any way remedied.
On January 14th the march was begun in a thick
fog and bitter cold, along roads frozen as smooth as
glass.</p>

<p>The maintenance of supplies required special attention,
and at first the 8th Brigade had to be left behind
to secure the all-important railway-line Tonnerre&mdash;Nuits&mdash;Châtillon,
until connections could be established
by way of Epinal.</p>

<p>On the very first day's march the advanced guard
of the VIIth Corps had a fight before Langres. A force
from the garrison of 15,000 men was driven in on the
fortress with the loss of a flag, and a detachment had
to be left behind in observation of the place. Under
cover of it the VIIth Corps marched past the fortress
next day, while the IInd advanced to the Ignon
Brook.</p>

<p>The weather changed during the night of the 15th.
As a change from fourteen degrees of frost there came
storm and rain. The water lay on the frozen roads,
and it was with the greatest difficulty that the VIIth
Corps reached Prauthoy, and the IInd Moloy, closing in
to the left.</p>

<p>On the 18th the left wing advanced South-East on
Frettes and Champlitte, the right assembled at Is sur
Tille, and its advanced guard, after a march of thirty-one
miles, reached the bridges at Gray. On the flank
and rear of the Corps there had been some trivial
fighting, but the cruel march across the mountains had
been accomplished, and the cultivated valley of the
Saône was reached.</p>

<p>General von Manteuffel had already received news of
the satisfactory course of the first day's fighting on the
Lisaine. Later telegrams from General von Werder
reported that the French Army of the East would
probably be obliged to retire under difficulties, and the
German commander at once determined to cut off its
retreat by advancing to the Doubs below Besançon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>The defeated French army was still numerically
greatly superior to the German force. The troops had
to be again called upon for severe exertions. They
were required once more to cross a thinly-populated
mountainous region, where it would be a matter of
great difficulty to procure food and the shelter needful
during the bitter winter nights. Strong hostile forces
had to be left in the rear at Langres, Dijon, and
Auxonne, and that under very insufficient observation.
However, in spite of every obstacle the advance in this
new direction was begun on the 19th.</p>

<p>The first difficulty would have been the crossing of
the Saône, here very deep and about sixty-six yards
wide, and full of drifting ice, had not the advanced
guard of the IInd Corps found Gray abandoned by the
French and both the bridges uninjured; whereupon it
occupied the town. The head of the VIIth Corps
crossed the river by the intact railway-bridge at
Savayeux, and by a pontoon bridge thrown across by
the pioneers higher up.</p>

<p>On the following day both Corps advanced in a
southerly direction, the VIIth to Gy, the IInd to
Pesmes. Here the latter also now crossed the Ognon
after driving off by artillery fire a French detachment
which tried to oppose the construction of the
bridges.</p>

<p>On the 21st, at half past two, the advanced guard
of the IInd Corps found Dôle occupied by the enemy.
General von Koblinski (commanding 5th Infantry Brigade)
attacked at once. In spite of a violent street-fight
in which the townspeople took part, the Grenadiers of
the 2nd Regiment made their way through the town
and on the further side seized a train of 230 waggons
of provisions and military necessaries, intended for
Besançon and left standing in the railway-station.</p>

<p>While the Doubs was thus crossed by the IInd Corps
at this point, so the VIIth Corps opened itself a passage
across the Ognon at Marmay and Pin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>General von Werder had been instructed to follow
close on the heels of the retreating enemy, and while
the latter still maintained his position on the front of the
XIVth Corps, the 2nd Baden Brigade on the right
wing had advanced to Etobon, while Colonel von
Willisen with his twelve squadrons had moved out
beyond Lure. On the left, Colonel von Zimmermann
with the East-Prussian Landwehr had driven the
French out of Ste. Marie. These detachments everywhere
found cast-away arms and portions of equipment,
and hundreds willingly gave themselves up as
prisoners.</p>

<p>During the next few days General von Werder
effected a general left-wheel to the south. The right
wing held Villersexel, and it was the left wing only
that met the enemy in great masses at L'Isle sur
le Doubs, and afterwards at Clerval and Baume les
Dames.</p>

<p>General Bourbaki had withdrawn from the Lisaine on
the 18th. The XXIVth Corps only was left on the left
bank of the Doubs, with orders to defend toward the north
the defiles in the steep mountain-paths of the Lomont
range eastward of Clerval; all the other troops withdrew
between the Doubs and the Ognon, with the Division
Crémer as rearguard. The Ognon might have formed
a natural protection for the right flank of the French
army, and orders had been given for the destruction of
all the bridges over it; but we have seen how little
they had been obeyed.</p>

<p>On the 21st the XVth and XXth Corps arrived in
the neighbourhood of Baume les Dames, the XVIIIth
at Marchaux; and here, having the stronghold of
Besançon close at his back, General Bourbaki desired
to await for the present the further movements of the
enemy. In order that his forces should still muster in
full strength, the commandant of Besançon was instructed
to send forward to Blamont all the battalions
of Mobiles-Guards he could spare so as to relieve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
XXIVth Corps. Nine battalions of mobilized National
Guards had actually previously reached Besançon, which
might have been substituted as desired, but they came
armed with Enfield rifles, for which there was no
ammunition in the fortress. Thus they would there
only have added to the mouths to be filled, and General
Rolland had simply sent them back again. The Intendant-General
declared it impossible any longer to bring
up the supplies ordered by him for the maintenance
of the army; but what proved decisive was the news
received this day that not only was the line of the Ognon
lost, but that the Germans had already crossed the
Doubs.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the French Commander-in-Chief
determined to continue his retreat on Besançon
and there cross to the southern bank of the Doubs, so as
not to be compelled to give battle with the river in his
rear. The trains were sent off during the night, but
above all things the XVth Corps was ordered at
once to occupy Quingey with a whole division,
and defend that position to extremity, in order to
keep open the communications of the Corps with the
interior. All the other Corps were to concentrate
round Besançon, even the XXIVth, which consequently
gave up the defence of the Lomont passes.</p>

<p>General Bourbaki reported his situation to the
Minister of War, who held out hopes of supporting him
with the portion of the XVth Corps still remaining on
the Loire. Assistance could have been more quickly
and effectually given from Dijon.</p>

<p>The Government had assembled there a very considerable
force to replace the Division Crémer gone to
join the Army of the East, for the defence of the ancient
capital of Burgundy and to constitute a point of support
to the operations of General Bourbaki. A Corps of
20,000 men was assigned to the local defence; a very
inappropriately-named Army of the Vosges, more than
40,000 strong, was to do duty in the field. But this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
of little effect in hindering the toilsome advance of the
Germans over the mountains. The detachments in
observation allowed themselves to be driven in by
General von Kettler (commanding 8th Infantry
Brigade), who followed the movement of both Corps
on the right flank; and they retired on Dijon. Colonel
Bombonnel, stationed at Gray, urgently begged for
reinforcements to enable him to defend the passages
of the Saône; his applications were refused because
Dijon was in too great peril, and it was not till the
Prussians had already crossed the river that "General"
Garibaldi began to move.</p>

<p>He set out on the 19th in three columns in the
direction of Is sur Tille, where there still remained
only part of the (German) 4th Infantry Division. But
he advanced little more than four miles. Garibaldi subsequently
confined himself to watching reconnoitring
parties which advanced to meet him from the heights
of Messigny, and he then retired on Dijon with his
troops marching to the strains of the Marseillaise.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the enemy was held in too small estimation
in General Manteuffel's headquarter, when General
von Kettler was simply ordered to go and take Dijon.</p>

<p>The greatest care had been bestowed in strengthening
the place. Numerous earthworks, and other erections
specially constructed for defence protected it to the
northward; more especially had Talant and Fontaine
les Dijon been transformed into two detached forts and
armed with heavy guns which commanded all the approaches
on that side. The whole constituted a position
which could be held against a much larger force than
the five and a half battalions of the 8th Brigade with
which General Kettler advanced to the attack.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fighting at Dijon, January 21st and 22nd.</span>&mdash;This
force had reached Turcey and St. Seine, and on
the 21st advanced in two columns from the west on
Dijon, still distant some fourteen miles. Major von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
Conta from Is sur Tille on the north was approaching
with a small reinforcement. The "Franctireurs de la
Mort," the "Compagnie de la Revanche," and other volunteer
bands as well as Mobiles-Guards were without much
difficulty driven out of the villages on the way, and
beyond the deep ravine of the Suzon; the village of
Plombieres on the right, which was defended with
spirit, was stormed, and Daix was carried on the left;
but in front of the fortified position of the French, and
within reach of the fire of their heavy batteries, the bold
advance was forced to come to a stand. Major von
Conta had also pushed on with continuous fighting, but
failed to effect a junction with the brigade before dark.
General von Kettler, recognizing the overwhelming
superiority of the French, finally restricted himself
to repulsing their sorties.</p>

<p>The French lost seven officers and 430 men in
prisoners alone; but the fighting also cost the brigade
nineteen officers and 322 men. The troops had performed
a severe march in bad weather along heavy
roads, and had not been able to cook either before or
after the fight; the ammunition could only be replenished
from a convoy which was expected next
day. Nevertheless General von Kettler did not hesitate
to remain for the night in the positions he had gained
immediately in front of the enemy, and then to seek
shelter-quarters in the nearest villages.</p>

<p>The French allowed him to do so without any serious
opposition. Inactivity so utter caused General von
Kettler the suspicion that the main body of the enemy
had probably withdrawn by Auxonne to the support of
the Army of the East, and he determined to bring it
back on Dijon by a renewed attack.</p>

<p>On the 23rd at eleven o'clock, by a flank march
along the enemy's front, after his advanced guard had
routed a detachment of Gardes-Mobiles, he reached the
farm of Valmy on the Langres road, and advanced with
his two batteries against the walled and strongly-held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
village of Pouilly. Here, as was almost always the
case when engaged in the defence of buildings, the
French made a stout resistance. The 61st Regiment
had to storm each house in turn, and it was not till the
château was in flames that the strong body of defenders
who had taken refuge in the upper floors,
surrendered.</p>

<p>Beyond this place the enemy were found deployed in
an entrenched position between Talant, which had been
converted into a fort, and a large factory-building on the
high-road. Here the advance was checked till the
remainder of the regiment came up from Valmy, and
the defenders at various points were driven back on
the suburb.</p>

<p>It was evident that the French were still at Dijon in
full force, and the object of the undertaking had therefore
been attained. But now unfortunately a tragic
episode occurred, for the storming of the factory was absolutely
insisted on&mdash;a great building, almost impregnable
against infantry unaided. When all the senior
officers had been killed, a first-lieutenant, whose horse had
been shot and he himself wounded, took the command
of the 2nd battalion. No sooner had the 5th company,
only forty strong, advanced from the neighbouring
quarry, than it came under a hot fire from all sides.
The leader was at once wounded, and the sergeant
who carried the colour fell dead after a few steps; so
did the second-lieutenant and the battalion adjutant,
who had again raised the standard. It was passed
from hand to hand, carried first by the officers then by
the men; every bearer fell. The brave Pomeranians<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
nevertheless rushed on the building, but there was no
entrance anywhere on that side, and at last the under-officer
retreated on the quarry with the remnant of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
little band. Here, for the first time, the colour was
missed. Volunteers went out again in the darkness to
search for it, but only one man returned unwounded.
It was not till afterwards that the French found the
banner, shot to ribbons, in a pool of blood under the dead.
This was the only German colour lost throughout
the war, and only thus was this one lost.</p>

<p>The enemy took prisoners eight officers and 150 men,
and the brigade sustained a fresh loss of sixteen officers
and 362 men. It mustered at Pouilly, and remained
under arms till eight o'clock to meet possible pursuit;
only then were quarters taken in the neighbouring
villages.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Operations of the Army of the South.</span>&mdash;The
commission to take Dijon could not be executed;
but the bold advance of this weak brigade cowed the
hostile army into inactivity, so that General von
Manteuffel was able to pursue his march unopposed.</p>

<p>He had given to both his corps as their objective the
enemy's line of retreat south of Besançon.</p>

<p>From this fortress there were but few roads to the
south of France available for troops, through the
riven and rugged regions of the western Jura. The
most direct connection was by the road and railway to
Lons le Saulnier, on which Quingey and Byans were
the most important barriers. Further to the east, but
by a wide détour, a road runs by Ornans, Salins and
Champagnole to St. Laurent and Morez. Several
ways, however, radiate from Besançon and converge in
Pontarlier, by using the passes peculiar to this range,
called "Cluses," which pierce transversely the mountain
chains and afford the valleys intercommunication.
From Pontarlier one road only runs past Mouthe, and
along the Swiss frontier in awkward proximity thereto.</p>

<p><i>January 22nd.</i>&mdash;On this day the advanced guard of
the 13th Division marched from Audeux to St. Vit,
and after breaking up the railway and plundering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
a number of loaded waggons, down the riverside to
Dampierre. On the way four bridges over the Doubs
were found uninjured and were taken possession of.
The advanced guard of the 14th Division moved from
Emagny to observe Besançon. The IInd Corps closed on
Dôle and pushed reconnoitring parties across the river.</p>

<p><i>January 23rd.</i>&mdash;The concentric movement of all the
bodies of the German army was continued.</p>

<p>General Debschitz, approaching from the north, in
passing Roches found only the abandoned camping
ground of the French XXIVth Corps. The 4th Reserve
Division occupied L'Isle without opposition, and met
no resistance till it reached Clerval and Baume.</p>

<p>On the Ognon the Baden Division drove the French
out of Montbozon.</p>

<p>In the centre of the army the VIIth Corps pushed
the advanced guard of the 14th Division forward on
Dannemarie, near Besançon. A fight ensued there in
the form only of a cannonade which lasted till night.
The 13th Division, again, which had crossed the Doubs
at Dampierre, advanced on Quingey.</p>

<p>For want of rolling stock it had been possible to forward
only one French brigade by railway, and the last
trains were received at the Byans station with Prussian
shells. These troops were in so bad case that they
were unable even to place outposts. They abandoned
Quingey almost without a struggle, and their hurried
retreat on Besançon and beyond the Loue, stopped the
advance of reinforcements already on the way. Thus
800 prisoners and a train of 400 convalescents fell into
the hands of the Prussian advanced guard, who at
once broke up the railway at Abbans-dessous.</p>

<p>On the right wing, the head of the IInd Corps
advanced by the valley of the Loue on the southern
bank. Several cuttings on this road had been prepared
for defence, but were found undefended. It was
at Villers Farlay that it first encountered a strong body
of the enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>On the evening of this day, of the French forces the
XXth Corps was on the north and the XVIIIth on
the west of Besançon, at the distance of about four
miles. Cavalry, artillery and the train were passing
through the town or encamped on the glacis of the
fortress. The XXIVth Corps was on the march thither,
and the 2nd and 3rd Divisions of the XVth were in
possession of the southern bank of the Doubs about
Baume and Larnod; but the 1st Division had not succeeded
in holding Quingey. Thus the most direct and
important line of communications of the French army
was cut, and its position, by this fresh mischance,
seriously compromised. Impracticable projects and
counsels from Bordeaux poured in freely, but did not
mend matters; and on the 24th General Bourbaki
summoned the superior officers to a council of war.</p>

<p><i>January 24th.</i>&mdash;The Generals declared that they had
scarcely more than half their men under arms, and
these were more inclined to fly than to fight. General
Pallu alone thought he might answer for the men of the
army reserve. The Intendant-General reported that,
without trenching on the magazines of the place, the
supplies in hand would last for four days at most.
General Billot was in favour of attempting to fight a way
through to Auxonne, but he declined to take the command
in chief which was offered him. The exhaustion
of the troops and their evidently increasing insubordination
gave little hope of the success of offensive
operations. So there was no alternative but to retire
on Pontarlier, as the Commander-in-Chief had proposed.</p>

<p>This recourse, even, was seriously threatened. To
relieve himself from pressure on the north, General
Bourbaki ordered the XXIVth Corps to advance
once more and hold the Lomont passes. On the
south the XVth was to defend the deep mountain-ravine
of the Loue, and General Crémer was more
especially to cover the retreat of the army on the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
flank, which was most seriously threatened. For this
difficult task, in addition to his own Division, a Division
of the XXth Corps and the army reserve as the
most trustworthy troops were placed under his command.
The XVIIIth and the remainder of the XXth
were to await marching-orders at Besançon.</p>

<p>In the German Head-quarter, where of course the
plans of the French could not be known, various
possibilities had to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>If the French remained at Besançon there would be
no need to attack them there; the place was not suited
for the accommodation of a large army, and its supplies
could not long hold out. That they would again attempt
to advance northwards was scarcely likely; by
doing so they would be cutting loose from all their
resources, and must encounter the larger part of the
XIVth German Corps on the Ognon.</p>

<p>An attempt to break through to Dijon seemed more
possible. But this would be opposed at St. Vit by the
13th Division, at Pesmes by Colonel von Willisen's
detachment, and finally by General von Kettler.</p>

<p>Thus a retreat on Pontarlier seemed the most likely
course; and to hinder their further march from that
place would in the first instance be the duty of the IInd
Corps, while in the meantime the VIIth was observing
the enemy massed in Besançon, and opposing his
sorties on both sides of the river.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief therefore confined himself
to giving general directions to his Generals, expressly
authorizing them to act on their own judgment in
eventualities which could not be foreseen.</p>

<p>General von Werder was instructed to advance by
Marnay, and to place the 14th Division in touch with
the Baden Division and Von der Goltz's Brigade, and
then to distribute these bodies along the right bank of
the Doubs. The 4th Reserve Division restored the
bridges at L'Isle and Baume, and crossed over to the
left bank. Colonel von Willisen was to join the VIIth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Corps to supply its lack of cavalry. The IInd Corps
was assembled behind Villers Farlay.</p>

<p><i>January 25th.</i>&mdash;Reconnaissances on a large scale were
arranged for next day. The reconnaissance of the
VIIth Corps resulted in a sharp fight at Vorges. The
head of the IInd Corps met the enemy in front of Salins
and at Arbois, but found that the latter had not yet
reached Poligny.</p>

<p><i>January 26th.</i>&mdash;The advanced guard of the IInd Corps
advanced on Salins. The fronts of the high-perched forts
of St. André and Belin near the town, looked toward
Switzerland, but their fire commanded also on flank
and rear the plain to the south and west on the enemy's
line of march. Salins constituted a strong barrier on
the road to St. Laurent, and as long as it was held
would cover the line of retreat of columns marching
from Besançon to Pontarlier.</p>

<p>The two field-batteries of the advanced guard could,
of course, do little against the heavy guns of the forts;
but the Fusiliers of the 2nd Regiment advanced in
rushes of small detachments up the narrow ravine, scaled
its rugged faces, and, supported by the two Grenadier
battalions, forced their way, about half-past two, into the
railway-station and suburb of St. Pierre; but with the
loss of 3 officers and 109 men.</p>

<p>Soon after General von Koblinski arrived by way of
St. Thiébaud with the 42nd Regiment. As in consequence
of the representations of the Mayor the commandant
refrained from bombarding the town, the
advanced guard was able to take up its quarters therein;
the main body of the 3rd Division retreated from under
the fire of the forts on Mouchard, and the defile remained
closed again to further penetration. It was necessary
to turn it by the south.</p>

<p>In that direction the 4th Division had already marched
to Arbois, its head further forward up to Pont d'Héry;
it found Poligny and Champagnole on the right still
unoccupied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>The VIIth Corps reconnoitred both banks of the
Doubs, and found the enemy in strong positions at
Busy and at Vorges.</p>

<p>The 4th Reserve Division advanced along the southern
bank as far as St. Juan d'Adam, near Besançon; the
remainder of the XIVth Corps marched on Etuz and
Marnay.</p>

<p>General von Kettler's report of the fighting on the
21st and 23rd determined General von Manteuffel to
make a renewed attempt on Dijon. He detailed to this
duty General Hann von Weyhern (commanding 4th
Infantry Division, IInd Corps), placing him in command
of the 8th Brigade, with Colonel von Willisen's troops
and Degenfeld's Baden Brigade.</p>

<p>On the French side, General Bressoles had started on
the 24th, in obedience to orders, to take renewed possession
of the passages of the Doubs and the Lomont
defiles. He had, in the first instance, turned against
Baume with d'Aries' Division; but as he did not succeed
even in driving the German outposts out of Pont les
Moulins, he retired to Vercel. In consequence of this,
on the morning of the 26th, Carré's Division, which had
found the passes of the Lomont unoccupied, also moved
to Pierre Fontaine. Comagny's Division had already
retreated to Morteau, and was making its way unmolested
to Pontarlier.</p>

<p>General Bourbaki was greatly disturbed by this
failure of his right wing; more perhaps than was needful,
since, in fact, only one German division stood north
of him, which at most could drive his rearguard on
Pontarlier, while the main force of the enemy threatened
him far more seriously on the west. He nevertheless
ordered a renewed advance, on the 26th, of the XXIVth
Corps, which was now to be supported by the XVIIIth.
But the march through Besançon of the latter, through
streets covered with ice, took up the whole of the day
which should have been devoted to the attack, so that
nothing came of the scheme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>The Army Reserve had reached Ornans, and stood
there in readiness. The two other Divisions advanced
on the road to Salins, but heard while on the march
that the Germans had just carried that place. They
then occupied in Déservillers and Villeneuve d'Amont,
the roads leading from thence to Pontarlier.</p>

<p>The War Minister, meanwhile, had decisively refused
permission for the general retreat of the army, without
any regard to the imperative necessities of the case.</p>

<p>The military dilettanteism which fancied it could
direct the movements of the army from Bordeaux is
characterized in a telegram of the afternoon of the 25th.
Monsieur de Freycinet gives it as his "firm conviction"<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
that General Bourbaki, if he would concentrate his
troops, and, if necessary come to an understanding with
Garibaldi, would be strong enough to fight his way out,
"either by Dôle, or by Mouchard, or by Gray, or by
Pontailler" (north of Auxonne). The choice was left
to him.</p>

<p>Still more amazing was the further suggestion that
if indeed the state of the army prohibited a long march,
it should be embarked on the railway at Chagey, under
the eye, no doubt, of the pursuing enemy.</p>

<p>Such communications could only avail to shatter the
brave commander's self-confidence. The disastrous
reports which poured in from all sides, and the state
of the troops which he had seen for himself as the
XVIIIth Corps marched through the town, crushed his
last hope and led him to attempt his own life.</p>

<p>The Commander had of course to bear the blame of
the total failure of a campaign planned by Freycinet;
his dismissal from the command was already on its way.
General Clinchant was appointed in his stead, and under
these disastrous circumstances took the command of the
army.</p>

<p>All the Generals were, no doubt, extremely reluctant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
to bring their weary and dispirited troops into serious
contact with the enemy. Every line of retreat was closely
threatened, excepting only that on Pontarlier. The
new Commander-in-Chief had no choice but to carry
out the plans of his predecessor. He at once ordered
the further march. He himself proceeded to Pontarlier.
In that strong position he hoped to be able at least to
give the troops a short rest. No large bodies of the
Germans had been met with so far, the ammunition
columns had got safely through, and if the defiles of
Vaux, Les Planches, and St. Laurent could be reached
and held in advance of the enemy there was still a
possibility of escape to the southwards.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 27th, the Division Poullet was at
Levier, nearest to the Germans; the two other Divisions
under General Crémer, with the XVth and XXth Corps,
were écheloned on the road from Ornans to Sombacourt;
the XVIIIth Corps alone was on the eastern road
through Nods. The XXIVth, in a miserable condition,
had reached Montbenoît with its head at Pontarlier;
two Divisions were still in Besançon.</p>

<p>On this same day General von Fransecky collected
the main body of the IInd Corps at Arbois, and reinforced
General du Trossel's posts at Pont d'Héry.</p>

<p>The XIVth Corps relieved the 14th Division of the
VIIth Corps at St. Vit; the latter advanced to the
right of the 13th Division into the Loue angle, which
the French had already abandoned.</p>

<p>On the north, General von Debschitz held Blamont
and Pont du Roide, while General von Schmeling
watched Besançon from St. Juan, and General von der
Goltz marched on Arbois to form a reserve.</p>

<p><i>January 28th.</i>&mdash;Suspecting that the French were
already on the march by Champagnole on St. Laurent,
General Fransecky, to cut off from them that line of
retreat, advanced on the following day in a southerly
direction with the IInd Corps.</p>

<p>General du Trossel reached Champagnole without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
opposition, and thence sent his cavalry along the road to
Pontarlier. Lieutenant-Colonel von Guretzky arrived
at Nozeroy with a squadron of the 11th Dragoons, and
found the place occupied; but he made prize of fifty-six
provision-waggons and the military-chest, taking the
escort prisoners.</p>

<p>The 5th and 6th Brigades advanced on Poligny and
Pont du Navoy.</p>

<p>The 13th Division of the VIIth Corps, having been
relieved at Quingey by the Baden troops, assembled at
La Chapelle, while the 14th advanced on Déservillers.
Its head found no enemy in Bolandoz, although his
camp-fires were still smouldering; so that the main
hostile army was not overtaken on that day.</p>

<p>General Clinchant had in fact moved his Corps closer
on Pontarlier. But it soon became evident that
supplies were not procurable for any long stay there.
General Crémer received orders that night to move
forward at once to Les Planches and St. Laurent with
three cavalry regiments standing already on the road
to Mouthe. The mountain-roads were deep in snow,
but by forced marching he reached the points designated
on the following afternoon. The XXIVth Corps and a
brigade of the Division Poullett followed next day, and
the latter also occupied with two battalions the village
of Bonneveaux at the entrance to the defiles of Vaux.
On the evening of the 28th the rest of the French army
stood as follows: the XVIIIth Corps was behind the
Drugeon at Houtaud close before Pontarlier; the 1st
Division of the XVth had advanced over the brook to
Sombacourt, the 3rd Division was in the town. On
the left the 2nd and 3rd Divisions of the XXth Corps
held the villages from Chaffois to Frasne, and on the
right the army reserve occupied Byans.</p>

<p>General von Manteuffel had ordered for the 29th a
general advance on Pontarlier, where at last the French
must certainly be found.</p>

<p><i>January 29th.</i>&mdash;Of the IInd Corps General Koblinsky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
had set out from Poligny in the night. When he reached
Champagnole and had assembled the whole of the 5th
Brigade he moved forward therefrom at about seven
o'clock. General du Trossel with the 7th Brigade also
reached Censeau without finding the enemy.</p>

<p>On the right Colonel von Wedell marched from Pont
du Navoy on Les Planches with four battalions of the
6th Brigade. He found only dismounted troopers,
posts probably left by General Crémer which were
easily dispersed by the Jägers. Detachments were then
sent out in different directions, and everywhere met
with scattered troops; but at Foncine le Bas the head
of the XXIVth Corps was found, and Colonel von Wedell
now blocked the last line of retreat which had remained
to the French.</p>

<p>With the rest of the IInd Corps General von Hartmann
marched unopposed on Nozeroy.</p>

<p>The 14th Division of the VIIth Corps had not received
the order to advance on Pontarlier till somewhat
late; it did not start from Déservillers until noon,
and only reached Levier at three o'clock, where, at the
same hour, the head of the 13th Division also arrived
from Villeneuve d'Amont, the state of the roads having
greatly delayed its march.</p>

<p>The advanced guard of three battalions, half a
squadron, and one battery, had met only stragglers on
the way, and General von Zastrow commanded it to
push forward to the Drugeon brook. In the forest on
the left of the road closed detachments of the enemy
were retiring on Sombacourt, and Major von Brederlow
with the 1st battalion of the 77th Regiment turned off
to attack that village lying on the flank. The 2nd
company under Captain von Vietinghof dashed into it
through Sept Fontaines with loud cheers, and was at
once closely surrounded by strong bodies of the enemy;
but the other companies soon came to its assistance.
The first Division of the XVth French Corps was
here completely routed without the Army Reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
close at hand in Byans having come to its support.
Fifty officers, including two generals, and 2700 men
were taken prisoners; ten guns, seven mitrailleuses,
forty-eight waggons, 319 horses and 3500 stand of arms
fell into the hands of the Hanoverian battalion<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> which
was left in occupation of Sombacourt.</p>

<p>The rest of the advanced guard had meanwhile approached
Chaffois, where the road opens out from the
mountains into the wide valley of the Drugeon. That
village, as we have seen, was occupied by the 2nd
Division of the XXth Corps.</p>

<p>Colonel von Cosel passed at once to the attack.
Three companies of the 53rd Regiment surprised the
French field-posts and took possession of the first houses
of the village, but then the whole mass of the French
XVIIIth Corps barred his further progress. By degrees
all the available forces had to join in the
fighting, and also reinforcements had to be brought up
from the main body of the 14th Division. The fight
lasted with great obstinacy for an hour and a half, when
suddenly the French ceased firing and laid down their
arms. They claimed that an armistice had already
been agreed on.</p>

<p>Monsieur Jules Favre had, in fact, telegraphed to
Bordeaux at a quarter-past eleven on the night of the
28th, that an armistice of twenty-one days had been
concluded, without adding, however, that, with his consent,
the three eastern departments had been excluded
from its operations. The information, in this imperfect
form, was transmitted to the civil authorities by the
Delegation at 12.15 of the 29th; but Monsieur Freycinet
did not forward it to the military authorities, whom
the matter principally concerned, till 3.30 in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>Thus could General Clinchant in all good faith transmit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
to General Thornton, in command of the Divisions
at Chaffois, a message which, as regarded the Army of
the East, was altogether incorrect. The latter at once
sent his staff officer to the Prussian advanced guard,
which was still in action, who demanded the cessation
of the firing in recognition of the official communication.</p>

<p>General von Manteuffel had received in Arbois at
five in the morning, full particulars from the supreme
Head-quarter of the terms of the armistice, according
to which the army of the South was to prosecute its
operations to a final issue. An army order announcing
this to all the troops was at once sent out, but did not
reach the VIIth Corps till evening.</p>

<p>Nothing was known there of any armistice; however,
the tidings might be on the way, and General von
Zastrow granted the temporary cessation of hostilities,
and even sanctioned the release of his prisoners, but
without their arms.</p>

<p>Chaffois, with the exception of a couple of farmsteads,
remained in possession of the 14th Division,
which found such quarters there as might be; the
13th occupied the villages from Sept Fontaines back
to Déservillers.</p>

<p><i>January 30th.</i>&mdash;In full confidence in the news from
the seat of Government, General Clinchant, on the 30th,
suspended the movements of his army. The newly-appointed
Commander of the XXIVth Corps, General
Comagny, also gave up his intended attempt to cut his
way with 10,000 men at Foncine through Colonel von
Wedell's weak brigade. The other Corps, after the unfortunate
course of the fighting on the previous evening,
had drawn in close on Pontarlier; but detachments of
cavalry were sent out on the roads to Besançon and St.
Laurent, to establish a line of demarcation and also to
keep up communications with the fortress and with
Southern France.</p>

<p>On receiving the army order at about eleven o'clock,
General Zastrow gave notice to the enemy in his front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
of the resumption of hostilities, but restricted his immediate
demands to the complete evacuation of Chaffois,
which was complied with. Otherwise the Corps remained
inactive where it was.</p>

<p>Of the IInd Corps General du Trossel had set out
very early from Censeau, but the appearance of a French
flag of truce, and his fear of offending against the law
of nations, here too occasioned considerable hesitation.
The forest of Frasne was not clear of the French till evening.
Lieutenant-Colonel von Guretzky made his way
into the village with quite a small force, and took
prisoners twelve officers and 1500 men who held it, with
two colours. The 5th Brigade then also moved up
into Frasne; the rest of the Corps occupied the same
quarters as on the previous day.</p>

<p>A flag of truce had presented itself at Les Planches,
but Colonel von Wedell had simply dismissed the bearer.
The outposts of the XIVth Corps did the same.</p>

<p>On the north of Pontarlier, General von Schmeling
advanced to Pierre Fontaine, General von Debschitz
to Maiche.</p>

<p><i>January 31st.</i>&mdash;Early in the morning of this day the
French Colonel Varaigne made his appearance at
General von Manteuffel's head-quarters at Villeneuve,
with the proposal that a cessation of hostilities for thirty-six
hours should be agreed upon, till the existing condition
of uncertainty should be removed; but this
proposal was refused, as on the German side there were
no doubts whatsoever. Permission was granted for the
despatch of an application to Versailles, but it was at the
same time explained that the movements of the Army
of the South would not be suspended pending the arrival
of the answer.</p>

<p>On this day, however, the IInd Army Corps marched
only to Dompierre on a parallel front with the VIIth,
its advanced guard pushing forward on the Drugeon to
Ste. Colombe and La Rivière. Thence, in the evening,
a company of the Colberg Grenadiers crossed the steep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
mountain ridge and descended on La Planée, where it
took 500 prisoners. A right-flank detachment of two
battalions and one battery under Lieutenant-Colonel
Liebe marched unopposed up the long pass of Bonnevaux
to Vaux, and took prisoners 2 officers and 688
men. The enemy then abandoned the defile of Granges
Ste. Marie and retired to St. Antoine in the mountains.</p>

<p>The Corps had found every road strewn with cast-away
arms and camp utensils, and had taken in all
4000 prisoners.</p>

<p>Of the VIIth Corps, as soon as the enemy had been
informed of the resumption of hostilities, the 14th Division
bent leftward on the Drugeon and up to La Vrine,
whence a connection was effected with the 4th Reserve
Division of the XIVth Corps in St. Gorgon. The 13th
Division advanced to Sept Fontaines. Pontarlier was
now completely surrounded, and General von Manteuffel
fixed February 1st for the general attack thereon. The
IInd Corps was to advance from the south-west, the
VIIth from the north-west; General von der Goltz was
to establish himself in front of Levier in reserve.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French Commander-in-Chief had conceived
doubts whether everything was quite right with
the communications from his Government. All the
mountain-passes leading to the south were now lost, and
an escape in that direction was no longer to be hoped for.
General Clinchant had already sent rearward the baggage
and ammunition columns, the sick and worn-out men,
through La Cluse under shelter of the forts of Joux
and Neuv. And when in the afternoon a message from
Bordeaux brought the intelligence that in fact the
Army of the East had been excluded from the armistice,
the Commander-in-Chief summoned his generals to a
council of war. Every General present declared that
he could no longer answer for his troops. General
Clinchant himself therefore went out the same evening
to Les Verrières, to conclude negotiations he had already
opened, in virtue of which on the following day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
February 1st, the army was to cross the Swiss frontier
by three roads.</p>

<p>To cover this retreat, the Army Reserve was to hold
Pontarlier till all the baggage-trains should have passed
La Cluse, while the XVIIIth Corps was to take up a
covering position between the two forts. Defensive
works there were at once set about. What of the XVth
Corps on the way by Morez had failed in getting
through with the cavalry was to try to cross into
Switzerland at any available point.</p>

<p><i>February 1st.</i>&mdash;When the advanced guard of the IInd
Corps now advanced on Pontarlier from Ste. Colombe,
it met with but slight resistance at the railway station.
The Colberg Grenadiers took possession of the town
without a struggle, and captured many prisoners, but
then found the road on the further side entirely blocked
by guns and waggons. They could pass beyond on
either side of the road only with difficulty through
deep snow. Just in front of La Cluse the road winds
between high rocky precipices into the wide basin of the
Doubs, completely commanded by the isolated fortalice
of Joux perched on the solid rock. On debouching into
the open the foremost companies were received by a hot
fire. Four guns, dragged up thither with the greatest
exertions, could make no head against the heavy guns
of the fort, and the French themselves here passed to
the attack.</p>

<p>The Colberg Fusiliers had meanwhile climbed the
heights to the left, followed by the 2nd Battalion of the
Regiment and a battalion of the 49th Regiment, which
drove the French out of the farmsteads on the rifted
upland. The steep cliff on the right was also scaled,
several rifle sub-divisions of the 49th climbed the
acclivity up to La Cluse, and the Colberg Grenadiers
advanced to the foot of Fort Neuv.</p>

<p>To take the strong fortalices by storm was obviously
impossible, and furthermore because of the nature of the
ground the fugitive enemy could scarcely be overtaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
in force. Of the French, 23 officers and 1600 men were
taken prisoners, with 400 loaded waggons; of the
Germans, 19 officers and 365 men had fallen, mostly of
the Colberg Regiment. The troops spent the night on
the field of the fighting.</p>

<p>As no large force could come into action at La Cluse,
General von Fransecky had ordered the main body of
the Corps to march further southward to Ste. Marie.
To avoid the necessity of crossing the steep chain of
the Jura, General von Hartmann first betook himself
to Pontarlier to avail himself of the better roads
from thence, but his progress was stopped, the fight
at La Cluse having assumed unexpected proportions.
The VIIth Corps and the 4th Reserve Division, which
had reached the Doubs at noon, were equally unable to
get at the enemy.</p>

<p>During the whole day the French columns were
crossing the Swiss frontier. The Army Reserve in
Pontarlier was at the beginning swept away by the
tide of baggage-waggons and drivers, and only joined
the XVIIIth Corps on reaching La Cluse. During the
night they both followed the general line of retreat.
Only the cavalry and the 1st Division of the XXIVth
Corps reached the neighbouring department of l'Ain
to the southward, the latter force reduced to a few
hundred men. There crossed the frontier on to Swiss
soil some 80,000 Frenchmen.</p>

<p>General Manteuffel had transferred his headquarters
to Pontarlier. There, in the course of the night, he
first heard through Berlin of the convention arranged
between General Clinchant and Colonel Herzog of the
Swiss Confederation.</p>

<p>General von Manteuffel had achieved the important
success of his three weeks' campaign by hard marching
and constant fighting, although there had been no
pitched battle since that of the Lisaine. These marches,
indeed, had been such as none but well-seasoned troops
could have accomplished under bold and skilful leadership,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
under every form of fatigue and hardship, in the
worst season and through a difficult country.</p>

<p>Thus two French armies were now prisoners in
Germany, a third interned in the capital, and the fourth
disarmed on foreign soil.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">General Hann von Weyhern's March on Dijon.</span></h2>


<p>It only remains to cast a backward glance on the advance
on Dijon, with the conduct of which General Hann
von Weyhern was charged on January 26th.</p>

<p>On that same day Garibaldi received instructions
there to take energetic measures against Dôle and
Mouchard.</p>

<p>To support him, the Government, indefatigable in
the evolution of new forces, was to put in march 15,000
Gardes-Mobiles under General Crouzat from Lyons to
Lons le Saulnier, and a XXVIth Corps in course of
formation at Châtellerault was to be sent from thence
to Beaune. As it was beyond doubt that General von
Manteuffel had moved with a strong force on the communications
of the Army of the East, the specific order
was transmitted on the 27th to the Commander of the
Army of the Vosges, to leave only from 8000 to 10,000
men in Dijon and to advance at once with his main
force beyond Dôle.</p>

<p>But the General was always greatly concerned for the
safety of Dijon; he occupied the principal positions on
the slopes of the Côte d'Or and detached a small force
to St. Jean de Losne, behind the canal of Bourgogne.
Of 700 volunteers who had marched on Dôle, no trace
was ever found there.</p>

<p>Langres had shown more energy; several and
often successful attacks on small outpost companies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
etappen troops had been made from it from time to
time.</p>

<p>General Hann von Weyhern's purpose of attacking
Dijon from the south had to be abandoned, because the
bridge over the Saône at St. Jean de Losne had been
destroyed. He therefore on the 29th crossed the river
at Apremont, and on the 31st assembled his detachments
at Arc sur Tille. Here again General Bordone,
the Chief of the general staff of the Army of the
Vosges, vainly insisted that an armistice was in force.
On the 31st General von Kettler marched with an
advanced guard on Varois. To cut off the enemy's
communications with Auxonne a left-flank detachment
made itself master of the bridge over the Ouche at
Fauverney. The first shells drove the French back on
their intrenched position on the line St. Apollinaire&mdash;Mirande.</p>

<p>When the attempt to establish an armistice failed,
General Bordone determined to evacuate Dijon in the
course of the night and retire upon assured neutral
ground. Thus, on February 1st, the head of the advanced
guard found the position in front of the city
abandoned, and General von Kettler marched in without
encountering any opposition, just as the last train
of French troops moved out of the railway-station.
Sombernon and Nuits were also occupied on the 2nd.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Occupation of the Departments of the Doubs, Jura,
and Côte d'Or.</span></h2>


<p>Nothing now remained for General von Manteuffel
but to establish the military occupation of the three
Departments which he had won, and to guard them
from without.</p>

<p>General Pelissier was still in the open field within
their bounds, having reached Lons le Saulnier with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
15,000 Gardes-Mobiles who had come up from Lyons
and had been joined by the battalions sent back
from Besançon by General Rolland, by no means an
insignificant force numerically, but practically of no
great efficiency. The commanders were recommended
to retire and avoid further bloodshed; and they did so,
as soon as some detachments of the IInd German Corps
advanced on Lons le Saulnier and St. Laurent. Others
occupied Mouthe and Les Allemands, where were
found twenty-eight field-guns which had been abandoned
by the French. As a measure of precaution,
the Swiss frontier was watched by eight battalions.
The fortalices of Salins, the little fortress of Auxonne,
and Besançon, were kept under observation from the
eastward. Although the Department of Haute-Marne
was included in the armistice, the commandant of
Langres had refused to recognize the authority of his
Government. So this place had to be invested, and
probably besieged. General von der Goltz was
promptly ordered to advance once more on it, and
General von Krenski was already on the march thither
with seven battalions, two squadrons and two batteries,
and a siege train from Longwy, which he had brought
to capitulate on January 25th, after a bombardment of
six days' duration. But it was not called into requisition
at Langres. General von Manteuffel aimed at
no further tactical results; he was anxious to save his
troops from further losses, and to afford them all possible
relief after their exceptional exertions. Not
till now were the baggage-waggons brought up, even
those of the superior staff officers having been necessarily
left behind during the advance into the Jura.
The troops were distributed for the sake of comfort
in roomy quarters, but in readiness for action at any
moment, the IInd Corps in the Jura, the VIIth in the
Côte d'Or, the XIVth in the department of the Doubs.
But the siege of Belfort was still to be vigorously
carried on.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Prosecution of the Siege of Belfort.</span></h2>


<p>Immediately after the battle on the Lisaine the forces
investing Belfort were increased to 27 battalions, 6
squadrons, 6 field batteries, 24 companies of fortress
artillery, and 6 companies of fortress pioneers; 17,602
infantry, 4699 artillerymen, and 1166 pioneers, in all
23,467 men, with 707 horses and 34 field-guns.</p>

<p>The place was invested on the north and west by
only a few battalions, and the main force was assembled
to the south and east.</p>

<p>On January 20th the eastern batteries opened a
heavy fire on Pérouse. Colonel Denfert concluded that
an attack was imminent, and placed four battalions of
his most trusted troops in the village, which had been
prepared for an obstinate defence.</p>

<p>At about midnight, two battalions of the 67th Regiment
advanced from Chêvremont on the Haut Taillis
wood without firing a shot. Once inside it there was a
determined struggle, but the French were driven back
on the village, and the pioneers immediately intrenched
the skirt of the wood towards Pérouse under a heavy
fire from the forts. Half an hour later two Landwehr
battalions advanced from Bessoncourt to the copse on
the north of the village. They were received with a
heavy fire, but made their way onward over abatis,
pits and wire-entanglements, driving the enemy back
into the quarries. A stationary fight now ensued, but
the 67th presently renewed the attack, and without
allowing themselves to be checked by the earthworks
forced their way into Pérouse. They took possession
of the eastern half of the straggling village at about
half-past two, and the detachment defending the
quarries, finding itself threatened, retreated. At five
o'clock, Colonel Denfert abandoned the western part of
the village, which was now completely occupied by the
Germans. The losses on the German side were 8 officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
and 178 men; the French left 5 officers and 93 men
prisoners.</p>

<p><i>January 21st to 27th.</i>&mdash;The next day the construction
of the first parallel was undertaken, extending about
2000 yards from Donjoutin to Haut Taillis. Five battalions
and two companies of Sappers were employed in
this work, and were undisturbed by the French; but
the rocky soil prevented its being constructed of the
prescribed width.</p>

<p>General von Tresckow considered that he might thus
early succeed in carrying both the Perches forts by a
determined assault. Two half redoubts with ditches
more than three yards deep cut perpendicularly in the
solid rock, casemated traverses and bomb-proof blockhouses
in the gorge, afforded protection to the defenders.
Each work was armed with seven 12-cm. cannon, and
they were connected by trenches, behind which reserves
were in readiness. On the right flank this position was
protected by a battalion and a sortie-battery in Le
Fourneau; on the left the adjacent wood was cleared,
cut down to a distance of 650 yards, and wire-entanglements
between the stumps formed an almost impenetrable
obstacle. In front the gentle slope of the ridge
was under the cross-fire of the two forts.</p>

<p>When on the previous evening of the 26th the construction
of the parallel was sufficiently advanced to
allow of its being occupied by larger detachments, the
assault was fixed for the 27th. Two columns, each of
one battalion, one company of Sappers, and two guns,
passed to the attack at daybreak on that morning. Two
companies of Schneidemühl's Landwehr Battalion advanced
against the front of Basses Perches and threw
themselves on the ground within from 65 to 110 yards
of the work. A sub-division of sharp-shooters and a few
pioneers reached the ditch and unhesitatingly leaped
in; the two other (Landwehr) companies, going round
the fort by the left, got into its rear, and here too the
men jumped into the ditch of the gorge. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
French who had been driven out of their shelter-trenches
were now assembled, and the battalion from
Le Fourneau came up. All the forts of the place
opened fire on the bare and unprotected space in
front of the parallel, and an attempt of reinforcements
to cross it failed. The 7th Company of the Landwehr
Battalion was surrounded by greatly superior numbers,
and after a brave struggle was for the most part made
captive. Most of the men in the ditch were still able
to escape.</p>

<p>The advance of the right column against Hautes-Perches
also failed. It had to cross 1100 yards of open
ground. The encompassment of the fort was attempted,
but it was impossible to force through the abatis and
other obstacles under the destructive fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>This abortive attempt cost 10 officers and 427 men;
and the slower process of an engineer attack had to be
resumed.</p>

<p><i>January 28th to February 15th.</i>&mdash;As the approaches
to the forts progressed the flying sap could be
carried forward about 330 yards every night unopposed
by the enemy. In spite of all the difficulties
caused by the nature of the soil, on February 1st
the second parallel was thrown up at half distance
from the Perches.</p>

<p>As the Fort of la Justice was a special hindrance to
the operations, two new batteries had to be constructed
to the east of Pérouse against it. Four mortar-batteries
on the flanks of the parallel now directed their
fire on the Perches at very short range. Three batteries
were also constructed in the Bois des Perches to
fire on the citadel, and one on the skirt of the wood
near Bavilliers against the defences of the city. Henceforward
1500 shells a day were fired on the fortress
and its outworks.</p>

<p>But further the prosecution of the attack became more
and more difficult. The withdrawal of General Debschitz
had seriously reduced the working strength of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
besieging force. There were only nine battalions for
the exhausting service in the trenches. Specially serious
was the heavy loss in pioneers, and two fresh companies
had to be brought up from Strasburg. The
bright moonlight illuminating the fields of snow far
and wide made it impossible to proceed with the flying
saps. Sap-rollers had to be used; the heads of the
saps had to be protected by sandbags and the sides by
gabions, while the earth for filling had often to be
brought from a long distance in the rear.</p>

<p>On the head of all this, on February 3rd, a thaw set
in, and the water from the heights filled the trenches,
so that all communication had to be carried on across
the open ground. Torrents of rain damaged the
finished works; the parapet of the first parallel gave
way altogether in places, and the banquette was washed
away. The bottomless tracks made the arming of the
batteries unspeakably difficult, and the teams of the
columns and field artillery had to be employed in
bringing up the ammunition. Many guns had become
useless by overheating, while the enemy understood, by
rapidly running out their guns, firing, and then running
them back again, how to interrupt the work. Not
merely was it necessary to continue the shelling of the
Perches during the night, but a brisk rifle fire had
to be kept up against them. Only now and then
did the batteries newly placed in the parallels succeed
in entirely silencing the guns of Hautes Perches.
Epaulments had to be erected against Fort Bellevue
and the defences of the railway-station, and Fort
des Barres resumed activity. That under such exertions
and the abominable weather the health of
the troops suffered severely, need not be said; the
battalions could often only muster 300 men for
duty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, the artillery of the attack had
unquestionably become very much superior to that of
the defence, and, in spite of every obstacle, the saps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
were pushed on to the edge of the ditch of Les
Perches.</p>

<p>On February 8th, at one in the afternoon, Captain
Roese had gabions flung into the ditch of Hautes
Perches, sprang into it with five sappers, and rapidly
scaled the parapet by the steps hewn in the scarp. He
was immediately followed by the trench guard, but only
a few of the French were surprised in the casemated
traverses. The situation of the garrison of the forts had
in fact become extremely difficult. Ammunition had to
be brought up under the enemy's fire, water could only
be had from the pond at Vernier, and cooking could
only be done inside the works. Colonel Denfert had
already given orders to bury the material. Unseen
by the besiegers the guns of which the carriages
could still be moved had been withdrawn, and only
one company left in each fort, which in case of a
surprise was to fire and fly. Nothing was to be found
in the abandoned work but wrecked gun-carriages and
four damaged guns. This fort was at once reversed
so that its front faced the fortress, but at three o'clock
the latter opened so heavy a fire on the lost positions
that the working parties had to take shelter in the
ditches.</p>

<p>The garrison in Basses Perches attempted some
resistance, but under cover of a reserve it soon
retired to Le Fourneau, leaving five guns and much
shattered material. Here also the fire of the place
at first compelled the working parties to break off, but
four 15-cm. mortars were at length brought into the
fort, and two 9-cm. guns were placed on the spur of
the hill to the westward, which directed their fire on
Le Fourneau and Bellevue. During the night of the
9th the two works were connected by a shelter-trench
680 yards long, and thus the third parallel was
established.</p>

<p>The position was now such that the attack could
immediately be directed on the citadel, and on it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
batteries in the Bois des Perches and presently those
in the second parallel opened fire. Moitte, Justice,
and Bellevue were shelled simultaneously. General
von Debschitz had returned, so that the investing
corps was thus again brought up to its full strength,
and all the conditions were improved by the return of
the frost. By the 13th ninety-seven guns were ready
in the third parallel.</p>

<p>The town had suffered terribly from the prolonged
bombardment. Nearly all the buildings were damaged,
fifteen completely burnt down, and in the adjoining
villages 164 houses had been destroyed by the defenders
themselves. The fortifications showed not less visible
indications of serious damage, particularly the citadel.
The hewn-stone facing of its front-wall had crumbled
into the ditch. Half of the mantleted embrasures had
been shattered, the expense powder magazines had been
blown up, and a number of casemated traverses pierced.
The guns in the upper batteries could only be reached
by ladders. The garrison, of its original strength of
372 officers and 17,322 men, had lost 32 officers and
4713 men, besides 336 citizens. The place was no
longer tenable; besides there now came the news that
the army from which alone relief was to be expected,
had laid down its arms.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances General von Tresckow
summoned the commandant after a defence so brave to
surrender the fortress, with free withdrawal for the
garrison, this concession having the sanction of his
Majesty. The French Government itself authorized
the commandant to accept these terms. Colonel
Denfert, however, insisted that he must be given a
more direct order. To procure this an officer was
sent to Basle, pending whose return there was a provisional
armistice.</p>

<p>On the 15th a convention was signed at Versailles,
which extended the armistice to the three departments
which till then had been excluded from it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
also to Belfort; but the 1st article demanded the
surrender of that place.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the definitive treaty, the
garrison, in the course of the 17th and 18th, with its
arms and trains, left the precincts of the fortress and
withdrew by way of L'Isle sur Doubs and St. Hippolyte
into the country occupied by French troops. The
march was effected in detachments of 1000 men at
intervals of 5 km., the last of which Colonel Denfert
accompanied. The supplies which remained in the fortress
were conveyed in rear of the departing troops in
150 Prussian proviant waggons. At 3 o'clock in the
afternoon of February 18th Lieutenant-General von
Tresckow entered the place at the head of detachments
from all the troops of the investing corps.</p>

<p>There were found 341 guns, of which 56 were
useless, 356 gun-carriages, of which 119 were shot to
pieces, and 22,000 stand of arms, besides considerable
supplies of ammunition and provisions.</p>

<p>The siege had cost the Germans 88 officers and
2049 men, 245 of whom were released from imprisonment
by the capitulation. Immediately was set about
the work of restoring and arming the fortress, and of
the levelling of the siege works.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">The Armistice.</span></h2>


<p>On the basis of the agreement of January 28th a line
of demarcation was drawn, from which both parties
were to withdraw their outposts to a distance of 10 km.
The line ran south from the mouth of the Seine as far
as the Sarthe, crossed the Loire at Saumur, followed
the Creuse, turned eastward past Vierzon, Clamécy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Chagny, and then met the Swiss frontier, after bending
to the north of Châlons sur Saône and south of Lons le
Saulnier and St. Laurent. The two departments of
Pas de Calais and du Nord, as well as the promontory
of Havre, were particularly excluded.</p>

<p>The fortresses still held by French troops in the
districts occupied by the Germans were assigned a
rayon in proportion to their importance.</p>

<p>In carrying out the details of the agreement a liberal
interpretation was in most instances allowed. The
arrangements had the sanction of those members of the
Government of National Defence who were in Paris;
while the delegates at Bordeaux, who had hitherto
conducted the war, at first held aloof, and indeed, as
yet had not been made acquainted with the detailed
conditions. Gambetta, it is true, allowed the suspension
of operations, but could not give the commanders more
precise instructions.</p>

<p>General Faidherbe was thus without orders with
regard to the evacuation of Dieppe and Abbeville.
General von Goeben, however, refrained from taking
immediate possession of these places. On the west of
the Seine, the Grand Duke was forced to proclaim that
the non-recognition of the line of demarcation would
be followed by an immediate recommencement of
hostilities.</p>

<p>The commandant of the garrison at Langres also
raised difficulties, and only withdrew within his rayon on
February 7th, as did General Rolland later at Besançon.
Auxonne was at first unwilling to give up control of the
railway. Bitsch, which had not been worth the trouble
of a serious attack, repudiated the convention; the
investment had therefore to be strengthened, and only
in March, when threatened with a determined attack,
did the garrison abandon its peak of rock.</p>

<p>Nor did the volunteers acquiesce at once, and there
were collisions with them at various points. But after
the conditions were finally settled, no more serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
quarrels occurred between the inhabitants and the
German troops during the whole course of the
armistice.</p>

<p>All the German corps before Paris occupied the forts
lying in their front, more specifically the Vth took over
Mont Valérien, and the IVth the town of St. Denis.
Between the forts and the enceinte there lay a neutral
zone, which civilians were allowed to cross only by
specified roads placed under control of German examining
troops.</p>

<p>Apprehensive as it was of the indignation of the
populace, the French Government had hesitated so long
to utter the word "capitulation," that now, even with
the resumption of free communication, Paris was
threatened with an outbreak of actual famine. The
superfluous stores in the German magazines were
therefore placed at the disposal of its authorities. The
respective chief-Commands, the local Governments-General,
and the Etappen-Inspections received instructions
to place no difficulties in the way of the
repair of the railways and roads in their districts, and
the French authorities were even allowed to make use,
under German supervision, of the repaired railroads
which the invaders used to supply their own army.
Nevertheless, the first provision-train only arrived in
Paris on February 3rd, and it was the middle of the
month before the French had succeeded in remedying
the prevalent distress in the capital.</p>

<p>The German prisoners were at once given up. The
surrender of arms and war-material followed by degrees,
also the payment of the 200 million francs war-contribution
imposed on the city.</p>

<p>But it was still doubtful if the party of "war to the
bitter end" in Bordeaux would fall in with the arrangements
made by the Paris Government, and whether the
National Assembly about to be convened would finally
ratify the conditions of peace imposed by the conquerors.
The necessary measures in case of the resumption of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
hostilities were therefore taken on the French as well as
on the German side.</p>

<p>The distribution of the French forces at the establishment
of the armistice was not favourable.</p>

<p>By General Faidherbe's advice the Army of the
North was wholly disbanded, as being too weak to face
the strength opposing it. After the XXIInd Corps
had been transported by sea to Cherbourg, the Army
of Brittany under General de Colomb was composed of
it, the XXVIIth and part of the XIXth Corps, and,
including Lipowski's volunteers, Cathelineau's and other
details, its strength was some 150,000 men. General
Loysel with 30,000 ill-armed and raw Gardes-Mobiles
remained in the trenches of Havre.</p>

<p>General Chanzy, after his retreat on Mayenne, had
made a movement to the left, preparatory to a new
operation with the IInd Army of the Loire from the
Caen base, which, however, was never carried out.
The XVIIIth, XXIst, XVIth, and XXVIth Corps stood
between the lower Loire and the Cher from Angers to
Châteauroux, in a strength of about 160,000 men strong,
the XXVth under General Pourcet was at Bourges,
and General de Pointe's Corps at Nevers. The Army
of the Vosges had withdrawn southward of Châlons sur
Saône, and the remains of the Army of the East
assembled under General Crémer at Chambéry as the
XXIVth Corps.</p>

<p>The total of all the field-troops amounted to 534,452
men. The volunteers, even those most to be relied on,
were dismissed, and the National Guard was designated
as for the present "incapable of rendering any military
service." In the depôts, the camps of instruction, and
in Algiers there were still 354,000 men, and 132,000
recruits were on the lists as the contingent for 1871,
but had not yet been called up.</p>

<p>In case the war should be persisted in, a plan for
limiting it to the defensive in the south-east of France
was under consideration, for which, however, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
to the report sent on February 8th by the Committee
of Inquiry to the National Assembly, scarcely more
than 252,000 men in fighting condition were available.
The fleet, besides, had given up so considerable a
number of its men and guns for service on land, that
it was no longer able for any great undertaking at
sea.</p>

<p>On the German side the first consideration was to
reinforce the troops to their full war-strength, and
replenish the magazines.</p>

<p>The forts round Paris were at once armed on their
fronts facing the enceinte. In and between these were
680 guns, 145 of which were captured French pieces;
more than enough to keep the restless population under
control. A part of the forces previously occupied
in the siege, being no longer required, were removed,
in order that the remaining troops should have better
accommodation. Besides, it seemed desirable to
strengthen the IInd Army, which had in its front the
enemy's principal force. In consequence the IVth
Corps marched to Nogent le Rotrou, the Vth to Orleans,
and the IXth, relieved there, to Vendôme; so that
now the quarters of this army extended from Alençon
to Tours, and up the Loire as far as Gien and Auxerre.</p>

<p>The Ist Army was in the north with the VIIIth
Corps on the Somme, and the Ist on both sides of the
Lower Seine; in the south the Army of the South
occupied the line of demarcation from Baume to
Switzerland, and the country in the rear.</p>

<p>At the end of February the German field-army on
French soil consisted of:&mdash;</p>

<p>Arrangements were so made, that in case of a recommencement
of hostilities, the strongest resistance could
be made at all points. The armistice had nearly
reached its end, and the troops had already been more
closely collected to be ready to take the initiative of
the offensive towards the south, when the Chancellor
of the Confederation announced the extension of the
armistice to the 24th, which was again prolonged to
midnight on the 26th.</p>

<p>Considerable difficulties had arisen from the differences
of opinion with regard to the election of the
National Assembly, between the Government in Paris
and the Delegation at Bordeaux. The Germans wished
to see carried out the choice, not of a party, but of the
whole nation, expressed by a free suffrage. But Gambetta
had ruled, in violation of the conditions of the
armistice, that all who after December 2nd, 1851, had
held any position in the Imperial Government should
be ineligible to vote. It was not till the Parisian
Government had obtained a majority by sending several
of its members to Bordeaux, and after the dictator had
resigned on February 6th, that the elections proceeded
quickly and unhindered.</p>

<p>The deputies duly assembled in Bordeaux by the
12th, the appointed day. M. Thiers was elected chief
of the executive, and went to Paris on the 19th with
Jules Favre, determined to end the aimless war at any
cost.</p>

<p>Negotiations for peace were opened, and after five
days' vigorous discussion, when at last on the German
side the concession to restore Belfort was made, the
preliminaries were signed on the afternoon of the 26th.</p>

<p>France bound herself to give up in favour of Germany
a part of Lorraine, and the province of Alsace with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
exception of Belfort, and also to pay a war indemnity
of five milliards of francs.</p>

<p>The evacuation of the districts in occupation of the
German armies was to begin immediately on the ratification
of the treaty, and be continued by degrees in
proportion as the money was paid. While the German
troops remained on French soil they were to be maintained
at the charge of the country. On the other
hand all requisitioning on the part of the Germans was
to cease. Immediately on the first instalment of
evacuation the French forces were to retire behind the
Loire, with the exception of 20,000 men in Paris and
the necessary garrisons in the fortresses.</p>

<p>After the ratification of these preliminaries, further
terms were to be discussed in Brussels, and the return
of the French prisoners would begin. The armistice
was prolonged to March 12th; but it was in the option
of either of the belligerent powers to end it after March
3rd by giving three days' notice.</p>

<p>Finally, it was stipulated that the German Army
should have the satisfaction of marching into Paris, and
remaining there till the ratification of the treaty; but
would be restricted to the section of the city from Point
du Jour to the Rue du Faubourg St. Honoré. The
entry was made on March 1st, after a parade at Longchamps
before his Majesty of 30,000 men, consisting
of 11,000 of the VIth, 11,000 of the IInd Bavarian,
and 8000 of the XIth Army Corps. On the 3rd and
5th of March this force was to have been relieved by
successive bodies of the same strength, but M. Thiers
succeeded by March 1st in getting the National
Assembly at Bordeaux to accept the treaty, after the
deposition of the Napoleonic dynasty had been decreed.
The exchange of ratifications took place in the afternoon
of the 2nd, and on the 3rd the first instalment of troops
of occupation marched out of Paris back into its
quarters.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Homeward March of the German Army.</span></h2>


<p>By the IIIrd Article, the whole territory between
the Seine and the Loire, excepting Paris, was to be
evacuated with as little delay as possible by the troops
of both sides; the right bank of the former river, on
the other hand, was only to be cleared on the conclusion
of the definitive treaty of peace. Even then the six
eastern departments were still to remain in German
possession as a pledge for the last three milliards; not,
however, to be occupied by more than 50,000 men.</p>

<p>The marching directions were drawn up in the
supreme Headquarter, with a view as well to the comfort
of the troops as to the reconstitution of the
original order of battle, and the possibility of rapid
assembly in case of need.</p>

<p>The forces detailed for permanent occupation of the
ceded provinces marched thither at once.</p>

<p>The Reserve and Landwehr troops at home were to
be disbanded, as well as the Baden Division, which, however,
for the present was to remain there as a mobilized
force. The Governments-General in Lorraine, Rheims,
and Versailles were to be done away with, and their
powers taken over by the local Commanding-Generals.
In the maintenance of order in the rear of the army,
the VIth and XIIth Corps, as well as the Würtemberg
Field Division, were placed at the direct disposition of
the supreme Headquarter.</p>

<p>By March 31st the Army had taken full possession
of the new territory assigned to it, bounded on the
west by the course of the Seine from its source to its
mouth.</p>

<p>The Ist Army was in the departments of Seine-Inférieure
and Somme, the IInd in front of Paris in
the departments of Oise and Seine et Marne, the IIIrd
in the departments of Aube and Haute Marne, the
Army of the South in the districts most lately hostile.
The forts of Paris on the left bank were given up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
the French authorities; the siege park and the captured
war material had been removed. In consideration
of the desire of the French Government that the
National Assembly might be allowed as early
as possible to sit at Versailles, the supreme Headquarter
was removed to Ferrières, even sooner than
had been agreed. On March 15th his Majesty left
Nancy for Berlin.</p>

<p>All the troops that were left before Paris were
placed under the command of the Crown Prince of
Saxony, and General von Manteuffel was nominated
Commander of the Army of Occupation.</p>

<p>At the moment when France had freed herself by a
heavy sacrifice, an enemy of the most dangerous
character appeared from within, in the Commune of
Paris.</p>

<p>The 40,000 men left there proved themselves unequal
to the task of keeping the rebellious agitation under
control; which even during the siege had on several
occasions betrayed its existence, and now actually
broke out in open civil war. Large masses of people,
fraternizing with the National and Mobile Guards, possessed
themselves of the guns and set themselves in
armed resistance to the Government. M. Thiers had
already, by March 18th, summoned to Versailles such
regiments as could still be trusted, to withdraw them
from the disquieting influence of party impulses, and
for the protection of the National Assembly there.
The French capital was a prey to revolution, and now
became an object of pillage by French troops.</p>

<p>The Germans could easily have put a speedy end to
the matter, but what Government could allow its rights
to be vindicated by foreign bayonets? The German
Commanders consequently limited themselves to forbidding
at least within their own districts any movement
of disturbance, and to preventing all further
ingress into Paris from outside. The disarmament
operations which had commenced were interrupted;
the troops of the IIIrd Army were drawn closer to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
forts, and the outposts were replaced along the line
of demarcation, whereon 200,000 men could now
be collected within two days. The authorities in
Paris were also warned that any attempt to arm
the fronts facing the Germans would be followed
by the immediate bombardment of the city. The
insurgents however, were fully occupied in destroying
and burning, and in executing their commanders in the
interior of Paris. They did not turn against their
foreign enemy, but against the Government chosen by
the nation, and prepared for an attack on Versailles.</p>

<p>The high officers of State there, bound by the
conditions of the armistice treaty, were almost defenceless;
meanwhile the Germans were prepared and
willing to allow a reinforcement of 80,000 French
troops to be moved up from Besançon, Auxerre and
Cambrai, the transport of whom would be furthered by
the German troops in occupation of the districts
through which they would have to pass.</p>

<p>The release of the prisoners on the other hand was
temporarily restricted. These were, for the most part,
disciplined regulars; but they might not improbably
join the hostile party, so in the first instance only
20,000 troops of the line were set free.</p>

<p>On April 4th General MacMahon advanced with
the Government troops against Paris, and entered
the city on the 21st. As he was then engaged for
eight days in barricade fighting, and as great bands of
fugitives threatened to break through the German
lines, the IIIrd Army was ordered to take closer
order. The outposts advanced almost to the gates of
the city, and barred all communication through them
until, at the end of the month, Paris was again in the
control of the French Government.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the negotiations commenced in
Brussels and continued in Frankfort were making
rapid progress, and on May 10th the definitive treaty
of peace based on the preliminaries was signed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
mutual ratification followed within the appointed time
of ten days.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Thus a war, carried on with such a vast expenditure
of force on both sides, was brought to an end by
incessant and restless energy in the short period of
seven months.</p>

<p>Even in the first four weeks eight battles were
fought, under which the French Empire crumbled, and
the French Army was swept from the field.</p>

<p>Fresh forces, numerous but incompetent, equalized
the original numerical superiority of the Germans,
and twelve more battles needed to be fought, to safeguard
the decisive siege of the enemy's capital.</p>

<p>Twenty fortified places were taken, and not a single
day passed on which there was not fighting somewhere,
on a larger or smaller scale.</p>

<p>The war cost the Germans heavy sacrifice; they
lost 6247 officers, 123,453 men, 1 colour, 6 guns.</p>

<p>The total losses of the French were incalculable; in
prisoners only they amounted to:&mdash;</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Memorandum on the pretended Council of War in the Wars<br />
of King William I.</span>
</div>

<p>In the accounts of historical events, as they are handed down to posterity,
mistakes assume the form of legends which it is not always easy subsequently
to disprove.</p>

<p>Among others is the fable which ascribes, with particular zest and as
a matter of regular custom, the great decisions taken in the course of our
latest campaigns, to the deliberations of a council of war previously convened.</p>

<p>For instance, the battle of Königgrätz.</p>

<p>I can relate in a few lines the circumstances under which an event of
such far-reaching importance had birth.</p>

<p>Feldzeugmeister Benedek had, in his advance to the northward, to
secure himself against the IInd Prussian Army marching on the east over
the mountains of Silesia. To this end four of his Corps had one after
another been pushed forward on his right flank, and had all been beaten
within three days. They now joined the main body of the Austrian Army,
which had meanwhile reached the vicinity of Dubenetz.</p>

<p>Here, then, on June 30th, almost the whole of the Austrian forces were
standing actually inside the line of operations between the two Prussian
armies; of which the Ist was already fighting its way to Gitschin, designated
from Berlin as the common point of concentration, and the IInd
had also advanced close on the Upper Elbe; thus they were both so near
that the enemy could not attack the one without the other falling on his
rear. The strategic advantage was nullified by the tactical disadvantage.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, and having already lost 40,000 men in previous
battles, General Benedek gave up the advance, and during the night of
June 30th began his retreat on Königgrätz.</p>

<p>The movement of six Army Corps and four Cavalry Divisions, marching
in only four columns, which were necessarily very deep, could not be
accomplished in the course of a single day. They halted very closely
concentrated between Trotina and Lipa; but when on July 2nd they
still remained there, it was owing to the extreme fatigue of the troops,
and the difficulty, nay, impossibility, of withdrawing so large a body of
men beyond the Elbe, under the eyes of an active enemy and by a limited
number of passages. In fact, the Austrian general could no longer
man&oelig;uvre; he had no alternative but to fight.</p>

<p>It is a noteworthy fact that neither his advance on Dubenetz nor his
retreat on Lipa was known to the Prussians. These movements were concealed
from the IInd Army by the Elbe, and the cavalry of the Ist was
a mass of more than 8000 horse collected in one unwieldy Corps. The
four squadrons attached to each Infantry Division were of course not able
to undertake reconnoissances, as subsequently was later done in 1870 by a
more advantageous plan of formation.</p>

<p>Thus in the Royal head-quarters at Gitschin nothing certain was known.
It was supposed that the main body of the hostile army was still advancing,
and that it would take up a position with the Elbe in its front and its
flanks resting on the fortresses of Josephstadt and Königgrätz. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
were, then, these alternatives&mdash;either to turn this extremely strong position,
or attack it in front.</p>

<p>By the adoption of the first the communications of the Austrian Army with
Pardubitz would be so seriously threatened that it might probably be compelled
to retreat. But to secure the safety of such a movement our IInd
Army must relieve our Ist and cross over to the right bank of the Elbe.
And in this case the flank march of the latter close past the enemy's
front might easily be interfered with, if passages enough across the river
had been prepared by him.</p>

<p>In the second case, success could only be hoped for if an advance of the
IInd Army on the right flank of the enemy's position could be combined
with the attack in front. For this it must be kept on the left bank.</p>

<p>The separation of the two armies, which was for the present intentionally
maintained, allowed of either plan being followed; but mine was the
serious responsibility of advising his Majesty which should be chosen.</p>

<p>To keep both alternatives open for the present, General von Herwarth
was ordered to occupy Pardubitz, and the Crown Prince to remain on the
left bank of the Elbe, to reconnoitre that river as well as the Aupa and
the Metau, and to remove all obstacles which might oppose a crossing in
one or the other direction. At length, on July 2nd, Prince Frederick
Charles was ordered, in the event of his finding a large force in front of
the Elbe, to attack it at once. But, on the evening of that day, it came
to the knowledge of the Prince that the whole Austrian Army had marched
to and was in position on the Bistritz; and in obedience to instructions
received, he at once ordered the Ist Army and the Army of the Elbe to
assemble close in front of the enemy by daybreak next morning.</p>

<p>General von Voigts-Rhetz brought the news at eleven o'clock in the
evening to the King at Gitschin, and his Majesty sent him over to me.</p>

<p>This information dispelled all doubts and lifted a weight from my heart.
With a "Thank God!" I sprang out of bed, and hastened across to the
King, who was lodged on the other side of the Market Place.</p>

<p>His Majesty also had gone to rest in his little camp-bed. After a brief
explanation on my part, he said he fully understood the situation, decided
on giving battle next day with all three armies in co-operation, and desired
me to transmit the necessary orders to the Crown Prince, who was at
once to cross the Elbe.</p>

<p>The whole interview with his Majesty lasted barely ten minutes. No
one else was present.</p>

<p>This was the "Council of War" before Königgrätz.</p>

<p>General von Podbielski and Major Count Wartensleben shared my
quarters. The orders to the IInd Army were drawn up forthwith and
despatched in duplicate by two different routes by midnight. One, carried
by General von Voigts-Rhetz, informed Prince Frederick Charles of all the
dispositions; the other was sent direct to Königinhof.</p>

<p>In the course of his night-ride of above twenty-eight miles, Lieutenant-Colonel
Count Finckenstein had to pass the rayon of the Ist Army Corps,
which was furthest to the rear. He handed to the officer on duty a special
letter to be forwarded immediately to the general in command, ordering
an immediate assemblage of his troops and an independent advance,
even before orders should reach him from Königinhof.</p>

<p>The position of the Austrians on July 3rd had a front of not more
than 4-3/4 miles. Our three armies advanced on it in an encompassing arc
of about twenty-four miles in extent. But while in the centre the Ist and
IInd Corps of the Ist Army stood before daylight close in front of the
enemy, on the right wing General von Herwarth had to advance on the
Bistritz from Smidar in the dark, by very bad roads, above nine miles; and
on the left, the orders from the Royal head-quarter could not even reach
the Crown Prince before four in the morning. It was therefore decided
that the centre would have to maintain a detaining engagement for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
hours. Above all, a possible offensive on the part of the enemy must here
be met, and for this the whole IIIrd Corps and the cavalry corps stood
ready; but the battle could only be decided by the double flank attack by
both the flanking armies.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>I had ridden out early to the heights in front of Sadowa with my officers,
and at eight o'clock the King also arrived there.</p>

<p>It was a dull morning, and from time to time a shower fell. The
horizon was dim, yet on the right the white clouds of smoke showed that
the heads of the Ist Army were already fighting some way off, in front of
the villages on the Bistritz. On the left, in the woods of Swip, brisk
rifle-firing was audible. Behind the King, besides his staff, were his royal
guests, with their numerous suites of adjutants, equerries, and led
horses, in number as many as two squadrons. An Austrian battery seemed
to have selected them to aim at, and compelled him to move away with a
smaller following.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, with Count Wartensleben, I rode through the village
of Sadowa, which the enemy had already abandoned. The advanced guard
of the 8th Division had massed its guns behind the wood under cover of
the sharpshooters who had been sent forward, but many shells fell there
from a large battery in front of the exits from the copses. As we rode
further along the road we admired the coolness of a huge ox, which went
on its way, heedless of the shot, and seemed determined to charge the
enemy's position.</p>

<p>The formidable array of the IIIrd and Xth Austrian Corps' Artillery
opposite the wood prevented any attempt to break through it, and I was in
time to countermand an order which had been given to do so.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, further to the left, General von Fransecky had vigorously
passed to the offensive. After a sharp struggle he had driven the
enemy out of the Swip woods, and come through to the further side.
Against him he had the IVth Austrian Corps; but now the IInd and part
of the IIIrd Austrian Corps turned on the 7th Division; 57 battalions
against 14. In the thick brushwood all the bodies had become mixed, personal
command was impossible, and, in spite of our obstinate resistance,
isolated detachments were taken prisoners, and others were dispersed.</p>

<p>Such a rabble rushed out of the wood at the very moment when the King
and his staff rode up; his Majesty looked on with some displeasure,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> but the
wounded officer, who was trying to keep his little band together, at once
led it back into the fight. In spite of heavy losses the division got firm
possession of the northern side of the wood. It had drawn on itself very
considerable forces of the enemy, which were subsequently missing from
the positions which it was their duty to have defended.</p>

<p>It was now eleven o'clock. The heads of the Ist Army had crossed the
Bistritz, and taken most of the villages on its further bank; but these
were only the enemy's advanced posts, which he had no intention of
obstinately holding. His Corps held a position behind, whence their
250 guns commanded the open plain which had to be crossed for the
delivery of a further attack. On the right, General von Herwarth had
reached the Bistritz, but on the left nothing was yet to be seen of the
Crown Prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p><p>The battle had come to a standstill. In the centre the Ist Army was
still fighting about the villages on the Bistritz; the cavalry could not get
forward, and the artillery found no good position to occupy. The troops
had been for five hours under the enemy's lively fire, without food,
to prepare which there had been no time.</p>

<p>Some doubt as to the issue of the battle existed probably in many minds;
perhaps in that of Count Bismarck, as he offered me his cigar case. As I
was subsequently informed, he took it for a good sign that of two cigars I
coolly selected the better one.</p>

<p>The King asked me at about this time what I thought of the prospects of
the battle. I replied, "Your Majesty to-day will not only win the battle,
but decide the war."</p>

<p>It could not be otherwise.</p>

<p>We had the advantage in numbers,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> which in war is never to be
despised; and it was certain that our IInd Army must finally appear on
the flank and rear of the Austrians.</p>

<p>At about 1.30 a white cloud was seen on the height, crowned with trees,
and visible from afar, on which our field-glasses had been centred. It was
indeed not yet the IInd Army, but the smoke of the fire which, directed
thereon, announced its near approach. The joyful shout, "The Crown
Prince is coming!" ran through the ranks. I sent the wished-for news
to General von Herwarth, who meanwhile had carried Problus, in spite of
the heroic defence of the Saxons.</p>

<p>The IInd Army had started at 7.30 in the morning; only the Ist Corps
had delayed till about 9.15. The advance by bad roads, in part across the
fields, had taken much time. The hill-road stretching from Horenowes to
Trotina, if efficiently held, could not but be a serious obstacle. But in its
eager pressure on Fransecky's Division the enemy's right wing had made
a wheel to the left, so that it lay open to some extent to the attack on its
rear now impending.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince's progress was not yet visible to us, but at about half-past
three the King ordered the advance of the Ist Army also.</p>

<p>As we emerged from the wood of Sadowa into the open we found still a
part of the great battery which had so long prevented us from debouching
here, but the teams and gunners lay stretched by the wrecked guns.
There was nothing else to be seen of the enemy over a wide distance.</p>

<p>The Austrian retreat from the position grasped by us on two sides, had
become inevitable, and had, in fact, been effected some time before. Their
admirable artillery, firing on to the last moment, had screened their retreat
and given the infantry a long start. The crossing of the Bistritz seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
delayed the advance, especially of the cavalry, so that only isolated
detachments of it yet came up with the enemy.</p>

<p>We rode at a smart gallop across the wide field of battle, without looking
much about us on the scene of horror. Finally, we found our three armies
which had at last pushed on into a circumscribed space from their several
directions, and had got much mixed. It took twenty-four hours to remedy
the confusion and re-form the bodies; an immediate pursuit was impossible,
but the victory was complete.</p>

<p>The exhausted men now sought resting-places in the villages or the open
field as best they might. Anything that came to hand by way of food
was of course taken; my wandering ox probably among the rest. The
death-cries of pigs and geese were heard; but necessity knows no law, and
the baggage-waggons were naturally not on the spot.</p>

<p>The King, too, remained at a hamlet on the field. Only I and my two
officers had to journey some twenty-four miles back to Gitschin, where the
bureaux were.</p>

<p>We had set out thence at four in the morning, and had been fourteen
hours in the saddle. In the hurry of departure no one had thought of
providing himself with food. An Uhlan of the 2nd Regiment had bestowed
on me a slice of sausage, bread he had none himself. On our way back we
met the endless train of provision and ammunition waggons, often extending
all across the road. We did not reach our quarters till midnight.
There was nothing to eat even here at this hour, but I was so exhausted
that I threw myself on my bed in great-coat and sash, and fell asleep
instantly. Next morning new orders had to be prepared and laid before
his Majesty at Horitz.</p>

<p>The Great King<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> had needed to struggle for seven years to reduce the
might of Austria, which his more fortunate and also more powerful grandson<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
had achieved in as many weeks. The campaign had proved decisive in the
first eight days from June 27th to July 3rd.</p>

<p>The war of 1866 was entered on not as a defensive measure to meet a
threat against the existence of Prussia, nor in obedience to public
opinion and the voice of the people: it was a struggle, long foreseen
and calmly prepared for, recognized as a necessity by the Cabinet, not for
territorial aggrandizement or material advantage, but for an ideal end&mdash;the
establishment of power. Not a foot of land was exacted from defeated
Austria, but she had to renounce all part in the hegemony of Germany.</p>

<p>The Princes of the Reich had themselves to blame that the old Empire
had now for centuries allowed domestic politics to override German national
politics. Austria had exhausted her strength in conquests south of the
Alps while she left the western German provinces unprotected, instead
of following the road pointed out by the course of the Danube. Her centre
of gravity lay outside of Germany; Prussia's lay within it. Prussia felt
her strength, and that it behoved her to assume the leadership of the German
races. The regrettable but unavoidable exclusion of one of them from
the new Reich could only be to a small extent remedied by a subsequent
alliance. But Germany has become immeasurably greater without Austria,
than it was before with Austria.</p>

<p>But all this has nothing to do with the legends of which I am telling.</p>

<p>One of these has been sung in verse, and in fine verse too.</p>

<p>The scene is Versailles. The French are making a sortie from Paris, and
the generals, instead of betaking themselves to their fighting troops, are
assembled to consider whether head-quarters may safely remain any longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
at Versailles. Opinions are divided, no one dares speak out. The Chief of
the General Staff, who is above all called on to express his views, remains
silent. The perplexity seems to be great. Only the War Minister rises and
protests with the greatest emphasis against a measure so injurious from a
political and military point of view as a removal. He is warmly thanked
by the King as being the only man who has the courage to speak the truth
freely and fearlessly.</p>

<p>The truth is that while the King and his whole escort had ridden out to
the Vth Army Corps, the Marshal of the household, in his over-anxiety,
had the horses put to the royal carriages, and this became known in the
town; and indeed may have excited all sorts of hopes in the sanguine
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Versailles was protected by four Army Corps. It never entered anybody's
head to think of evacuating the town.</p>

<p>I can positively assert no Council of War was ever held either in 1866
or 1870&mdash;71.</p>

<p>Excepting on the march and on days of battle, an audience was regularly
held by his Majesty at ten o'clock, at which I, accompanied by the Quartermaster-General,
laid the latest reports and information before him, and made
our suggestions on that basis. The Chief of the Military Cabinet and the
Minister of War were also present, and while the head-quarters of the
IIIrd Army were at Versailles, the Crown Prince also; but all merely as
listeners. The King occasionally required them to give him information
on one point or another; but I do not remember that he ever asked for
advice concerning the operations in the field or the suggestions I made.</p>

<p>These, which I always discussed beforehand with my staff officers,
were, on the contrary, generally maturely weighed by his Majesty himself.
He always pointed out with a military eye and an invariably correct
estimate of the situation, all the objections that might be raised to their
execution; but as in war every step is beset with danger, the plans laid
before him were invariably adopted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> During a long peace the sphere of action of the War Minister's
department and the General Staff were not distinctly defined. The providing
for the troops in peace was the function of the former, and in war
time a number of official duties which could be superintended by the central
authorities at home. Thus the place of the Minister of War was not at
head-quarters, but at Berlin. The Chief of the General Staff, on the other
hand, from the moment when the mobilization is ordered, assumes the whole
responsibility for the marching and transport already prepared for during
peace, both for the first assembling of the forces, and for their subsequent
employment, for which he has only to ask the consent of the Commander-in-Chief&mdash;always,
with us, the King.
</p><p>
How necessary this disjunction of the two authorities is, I had to experience
in June, 1866. Without my knowledge the order had been given
for the VIIth Corps to remain on the Rhine. It was only by my representations
that the 16th Division was moved up into Bohemia, and our
numerical superiority thus brought up to a decisive strength. [<span class="smcap">Moltke.</span>]</p></div>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
